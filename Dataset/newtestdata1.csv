JVC MXJ200 Compact Stereo System (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"JVC's MX-J200 compact stereo may be small, but it packs a wallop. It offers a three-CD changer, a dual-well cassette deck (one of which is auto reverse), and an AM/FM tuner. The MX-J200's big sound and diminutive size make it ideal for the office, kitchen, or dormitory.The MX-J200 gets its big sound from its 60-watt-per-channel amplifier, a one-bit digital-to-analog converter, and an equalization mode called Active Bass Extension, which generates extra harmonics for bass frequencies too low for the system to reproduce in order to fool your ears into thinking you're hearing lower bass. This is a great stereo to make tapes with too. Thanks to CD synchro recording and play exchange, you can listen to one CD while changing another. The MX-J200 can handle up to 32 tracks of CD programming.Included in the package are a full-function remote control, an auxiliary input, and the handy Compu Play feature, which automatically plays the last CD or tape you were listening to before the MX-J200 was last turned off.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41W6F65VS0L._SX300_.jpg,134.5,,Electronics,Home Audio,Compact Stereos,,,

Pioneer VSX-D309 Audio/Video Receiver (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"With built-in Dolby Digital, DTS, and Dolby Pro Logic decoding, Pioneer's VSX-D309 surround receiver lets you take full advantage of today's 5.1-channel movies and music. Dialogue and sound effects come through with great clarity and spaciousness for an excellent home theater experience.The VSXD309 provides an ample 60 watts of amplifier power to each of its five channels (left/right front, center, and left/right rear). It also offers a subwoofer output for incorporating the "".1"" low-frequency effects (LFE) channel encoded on most DVDs and on DTS-mastered surround sound compact discs.Complete 5.1-channel analog inputs bring welcome flexibility, letting you use the VSX-D309 with a surround-decoding DVD player or a future six-channel surround format.Ten digital signal processing (DSP) environments transport you to your venue of choice--including hall, jazz club, and stadium--for a customized sonic experience.The midnight mode compresses dynamic range while slightly increasing the clarity of dialogue for late-night viewing sessions. Midnight mode also dims the VSX-D309's front-panel display.The VSX-D309 has plenty of standard features as well. Three audio-video inputs accommodate a DVD player, a VCR, and another component, such as a second VCR.

Pioneer VSX-108 Audio/Video Receiver (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"With 50 watts per channel and surround conveniences such as four-channel Dolby Pro Logic decoding and a dedicated subwoofer output, Pioneer's VSX-108 is an unbelievable home theater value. The receiver would also make a terrific integrated stereo amp even if you have no interest whatsoever in home theater; its subwoofer output is a boon either way.If you do opt for the home theater route, be aware that the VSX-108 is not compatible with 5.1-channel DVD surround sound (either Dolby Digital or DTS), but at this price it's hard to complain--there are easily enough four-channel Dolby Pro Logic-encoded VHS tapes and television broadcasts out there to keep you going until you're ready for an upgrade.The VSX-108 offers three audio inputs, two simulated-surround programs, 30 AM/FM presets for its onboard tuner, separate bass and treble controls, a loudness switch (to boost the extreme high and low frequencies when you're listening at low levels), and a preprogrammed audio-video remote control.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41AJK34PHZL._SX300_.jpg,134.5,,Electronics,Home Audio,Stereo Components,Receivers & Amplifiers,Component Receivers,

Pioneer VSX-D509S Dolby Digital Audio/Video Receiver (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"With both Dolby Digital and DTS surround decoding, S-video switching, 5.1-channel analog inputs, four digital-audio inputs, and the ability to deliver 100 watts across all five main channels, Pioneer's VSX-D509S is poised to satisfy many a movie and music fan. Its value goes deeper than its feature set, however: the VSX-D509S offers full-bodied sound with fine detail and texture. Vocals sound clear and well-defined, while the bass--crucial for dynamic surround-sound reproduction--is taut and authoritative. Operation is a breeze: the receiver's setup and controls work perfectly, and radio signals come in clear as crystal.Pioneer's four Advanced Theater modes (Musical, Drama, Action, and Expanded) enhance DTS and Dolby Digital playback, giving you plenty of options when it comes to surround-sound playback. Six stereo DSP (digital signal processing) modes for music simulate the sonic environment of a large wooden concert hall, a modern hall with stone walls, a jazz club, a dance club, and two different movie theaters.We like that the VSX-509S has S-video switching, a coaxial digital input, and 5.1-channel direct inputs, all of which are aimed at superior audio-video performance.Radio signals come in clear as a bell. Dolby digital and DTS surround processing are both excellent, and we even found the relatively subtle DSP modes to be more to our liking than usual.While we're pleased that Pioneer uses five-way binding posts for the front three channels, the surround channels use cheaper spring-loaded terminals, which require bare-wire connections--something to consider if you currently have banana-terminated speaker cable. This isn't a major shortcoming--most receivers use them--but we wish manufacturers would use identical connectors for all channels, especially in a performance-driven machine like this one.Pioneer's VSX-D509S's strengths are many, and the receiver represents a very fine value.--Wayne GarciaPros:Clean, rich soundDTS decodingS-video switching5.1-channel direct inputsCons:Spring-loaded push terminals for surround channels",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41SNHTBRXYL._SX300_.jpg,4.45,,Electronics,Home Audio,Stereo Components,Receivers & Amplifiers,Component Receivers,
Pioneer VSX-D409 Audio/Video Receiver (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"The VSX-409 surround receiver holds a place in a stellar receiver lineup from Pioneer. Its features include Dolby Digital, Dolby Pro Logic, and DTS surround decoding, future-ready 5.1-channel analog inputs, three digital audio inputs (including one coaxial), and delivery of 100 watts across all five amplified channels.Like other Pioneer receivers we've auditioned, the VSX-409's sound is very fine--rich, airy, and involving. What's more, the VSX-409 is a snap to operate.Even first-time users should have no trouble, thanks to the first-rate owner's manual.Pioneer's four Advanced Theater modes (Musical, Drama, Action, Expanded) enhance both Dolby Digital and DTS playback, while six music-oriented stereo DSP (digital signal processing) modes simulate the sonic environment of a large wooden concert hall, a modern hall with stone walls, a jazz club, a dance club, and two different movie theaters.The VSX-409 produced good detail and texture with our favorite CDs and DVDs, and its 100-watt amplifier showed no signs of stress or strain, consistently delivering tight, powerful bass. Vocals sounded natural and articulate--a must for quality home theater.Pioneer's Dolby Digital and DTS surround processing are both excellent, and the DSP modes, essentially alternate surround-sound algorithms, actually work without sounding gimmicky.Now for a couple gripes: though we loved the VSX-409's coaxial digital-audio capability, multiple digital-audio inputs, and 5.1-channel analog inputs, we wish the VSX-409 accommodated S-video, which is clearly superior to composite video. (Of course, while S-video is found on all DVD players and some VCRs, not everyone has an S-video-compatible television.)Another drawback is the push (clip-type) speaker terminals, which demand bare-wire connections. Bare wire offers certain advantages over banana-plug terminations, namely a more direct connection, but banana-friendly five-way binding posts are both higher quality and more convenient for hookup than push terminals.If you can live without S-video and aren't already invested in binding-post speaker terminals, Pioneer's VSX-409 packs a lot of performance into a moderately priced, high-value design.--Wayne GarciaPros:Clear, robust soundDTS decoding5.1-channel direct inputs2 sets of front left/right speaker outputsMultiple digital inputsCons:No S-video switchingClip-type terminals for all channels",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41DFZ4WH1JL._SX300_.jpg,134.5,,Electronics,Home Audio,Stereo Components,Receivers & Amplifiers,Component Receivers,

JVC RX-5000VBK Surround Receiver (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"JVC's RX-5000VBK surround receiver is a wonderful low-cost, entry-level receiver offering 5.1-channel analog inputs (primarily for use with a Dolby Digital- or DTS-decoding DVD player) and Dolby Pro Logic decoding (for use with surround-encoded VHS videocassettes and many TV broadcasts). It also outputs 100 watts per channel for each of its five main channels: left, center, right, and left and right surrounds.

Having these inputs instead of a fixed surround-decoding chip is convenient, however, in that you're not limited to amplifying any one or two surround sound formats; the RX-5000VBK will be compatible with DVD-audio and other possible formats.JVC, in typical deference to sound quality and good taste, uses five discrete amplifiers rather than using integrated circuits, a cheaper approach to signal routing.Dolby Pro Logic decoding unfolds matrixed four-channel material from specially encoded two-channel signals for left, center, right, and a monaural surround signal (which is sent to both of your rear speakers). JVC's digital audio processor delivers sounds sculpted to re-create the reflections and reverberations that make live performances so satisfying. The RX-5000VBK includes five sound field patterns: theater, hall, live club, pavilion, and dance club.3D-Phonic virtual Dolby simulates surround effects from just the two front speakers: dialogue is fixed on the center, making the TV screen a virtual sound source, while the surround components are synthesized by the digital signal processor and then mixed with the front signals and played back through the two front speakers.Electronic bass and treble controls allow you to customize the sound to your liking.

JVC RX-8000VBK Dolby Digital/DTS Audio/Video Receiver (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"The audio-video receiver is one of the most rapidly evolving species in the world of home entertainment, and JVC's RX-8000VBK is one of the finer specimens. At a time when consumer interest has lowered the price bar on popular technologies like Dolby Digital and DTS, it's exciting to see value-added products like this one, which offer clear-cut reasons to pay a little more.With impressive sonics and a feature set that must have kept a design team busy for months--including Dolby Digital and DTS 5.1-channel surround decoding, a beefy 100 watts for each of its five channels, 5.1-channel direct (analog) inputs, S-video switching, an onscreen display, a host of digital inputs, six DSP modes for music and movies, advanced home theater set-up procedures, and a phono input--the RX-8000VBK delivers not only excellent performance, but exceptional value.Unlike some of this receiver's competition, the RX-8000VBK's front panel is beautifully and intuitively laid out, with an uncluttered display window. We especially like the two jog-shuttle controls, one for source selection, the other a multifunction control for setting things like speaker balance, output level and delay times, crossover points for the subwoofer and main speakers, and dynamic range compression and for changing source names and customizing the DSP modes.Other noteworthy features include an A/B speaker switch for the front speakers, which lets you place a second set of speakers in another room or easily biwire speakers that have the required pairs of inputs. Four factory-set digital inputs correspond to DVD, CD, TV/DSB, and CDR sources. Sound select lets you watch a video source while listening to a different audio or video source.One-touch operation lets you assign and store different sound settings--like those for input level, bass boost, subwoofer level, balance, and DSP modes--to each source. Among other things, this feature frees you from cranking your subwoofer level up for movie viewing and back to rational levels for everyday music listening.The onscreen display (which turns your TV into a set-up window) and smartly arranged remote control make configuration relatively easy. And we love the RX-8000VBK's thoughtful connections, which include S-video switching, 5.1-channel direct inputs (useful if your DVD-video player has a built-in processor and essential for enjoyment of formats like DVD-audio), sturdy binding posts for all speaker terminals, coaxial digital input for DVD, and front-panel AV inputs. Finally, the phono stage is a happy surprise for the vinyl hounds among us.Performance-wise, the RX-8000VBK offers clear, precise midrange reproduction with vocal music as well as movie soundtracks. Individual instrumental textures--from a lilting piano to the raspy honk of a tenor sax--have authoritative presence. The high frequencies are slightly up-front and may sound overly bright if your speakers exhibit any peaks in the treble. Bass is solid and punchy, though not quite as lush as we've heard from other receivers. If you're using a subwoofer, however, this is a moot point.While we've been impressed with many current receivers, few have the top-to-bottom combination of features, performance, and value of JVC's RX-8000VBK. This is a serious contender.--Wayne GarciaPros:Very good, detailed soundS-video switchingBinding-post terminalsA/B speaker switchingCoaxial digital input and outputOnscreen displayPhono inputCons:Treble is a little up-frontDeep bass lacks body",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41THF34SZ2L._SX300_.jpg,134.5,,Electronics,Home Audio,Stereo Components,Receivers & Amplifiers,Component Receivers,
Philips CDR775BK Dual-Deck Audio CD Recorder (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"Philips' CDR775BK CD recorder smashes the $400 price point for dual-disc CD decks, bringing high-speed recording and hard-wired convenience to a new level of affordability.The deck works equally well as a recorder and as a player, thanks to its abundant hook-up options, though it doesn't muster the stellar quality from its analog outputs that you'll find in pricier CD recorders and players. (The digital outputs sound fine, however.)The CDR775BK is equally happy receiving data from either of the two established means of digital audio transmission (optical or coaxial), and its analog inputs let you feed the recorder from external devices such as a cassette deck or a turntable--though a turntable must first be routed through a phono preamplifier, such as the phono input on a receiver.Topping the list of cool playback features is the CDR775BK's DJ mode, which lets the two trays function independently; each ""deck"" offers a choice of analog or coaxial digital outputs. This means, taking the mode literally, that you can make yourself the life of a party by routing the deck's respective outputs into a DJ's mixer and letting fly with a new song just as the song from the other tray is fading out.Alternately, you can route the outputs to separate amplifiers or receivers and enjoy simultaneous playback of different music in different rooms. Even cooler: you can program up to 99 tracks, switching between the two decks at will with no waiting during the switching (using analog or digital outputs).You can also customize your CDs by recording at either normal or double speed from the player deck to the recorder deck. Double-speed recording can only take place during internal digital dubbing, however. CDs made from analog or external digital sources--or discs made from copies of digital recordings (see the accompanying FAQ for more details)--must be made at single speed.All recording falls into one of five categories. In any category, the process is the same: first select the type of recording you'll be making, then hit Record--it's pretty much as simple as that.A category called MAKE CD will digitally record the CD in the playback tray at high speed and automatically finalize the disc (that is, prepare it for use in standard CD players) upon completion, coming as close as can be to one-touch recording.RECORD FAST is similar, but will not finalize the disc, letting you add additional tracks at normal speed or material from a different source before completing the CD. RECORD LISTEN makes a digital recording at single speed, resulting in the most faithful sounding digital reproductions. RECORD EXTERNAL DISC will commence recording upon the CDR775's sensing of a digital signal from an external digital source, while the last method, RECORD EXTERNAL MANUAL, lets you tell the recorder when to begin recording from an external source, either analog or digital.One thing this recorder does that may be unique to Philips recorders is to cancel a recorded track altogether if you hit stop within three seconds of initiating a recording. This prevents false starts (as when you miss the beginning of a track you're recording from vinyl or cassette) by letting you stop the recording and begin the track anew; other decks will record the glitch and offer no means for erasing or skipping it later.We found the recorder to be finicky about the brand and duration of discs used. As with all component CD recorders, you must use designated ""music"" or ""audio"" CD-Rs and CD-RWs with the CDR775BK. We got the most consistently favorable results with 74-minute Memorex audio CD-Rs, though the recorder worked fine with most 80-minute Memorex discs as well (occasional discs would record but refuse to finalize).A headphone jack is a huge convenience, but for some reason Philips neglected to supply a volume control for it, so you're stuck with a single (to our ears) very loud output.Other drawbacks include downright strange sound from the standard analog stereo outputs (bloated bass and tizzy treble) and the absence of a fade-in/-out button (forcing you to record from the analog inputs and perform manual fades if you want smooth transitions on cuts from live albums or if you want to squeeze a three-minute song onto the end of a disc with only 2:45 remaining).Nevertheless, given everything the CDR775 does--and the price at which it does it--this CD recorder makes an exciting production tool for the inner DJ in all of us.--Michael MikesellPros:Continuous play (deck 1 to deck 2)99-track programming across both discsHigh-quality analog-to-digital convertersWill cancel a mistake if recording is stopped within 3 secondsHigh-speed dubbingHeadphone jackIndependent digital outputsCons:No volume control for headphone jackNo fade-in/-out commandPoor sound from analog outputs",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31VR02YDTKL._SX300_.jpg,190,,Electronics,Home Audio,Stereo Components,CD Players & Recorders,CD Recorders,

Wharfedale Modus Music Center Channel (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"Wharfedale's Modus Music center-channel speaker is designed to help you  enjoy your favorite multichannel music (such as concert videos and DTS 5.1- channel surround CDs) the way it was intended to be heard. The 5-inch  bass/midrange units are made with a mineral-loaded homopolymer to create the  rigidity needed for dynamic bass, without the associated ringing.There's no disputing the need for a quality center-channel speaker: about 80  percent of a movie's sound is routed through the center channel, and today's DTS  music CDs are mixed for five full-range speakers. All of this recommends the use  of Wharfedale's Modus Music, which has a frequency response of 65 to 22,000 Hz.  This means you'll hear more bass frequencies than you would through the average  center-channel speaker, bringing home theater and multichannel music closer to  the real thing.Reaping the benefits of Wharfedale's years of experience and extensive research  in sonic airflow, the Modus Music Center's 1-inch, silk-globe tweeter offers a  distinct advantage--primarily, excellent localization--over more traditional  designs.Shielded components allow distortion-free placement near video monitors.

Wharfedale Diamond 7.1 Bookshelf Speakers (Black Ash) (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"British loudspeakers are known and cherished for their precision and detail, and Wharfedale brings hefty helpings of both to a tiny, affordable speaker with astoundingly beefy low end. This two-way speaker is ported at the back--as it would have to be to pump out sound below 50 Hz. The amazing thing is that Wharfedale resorts to porting without also defaulting to a tubby, muddy, or grievously unbalanced tonal character. The Diamond 7.1s are cheery little things, extremely well suited to rear-channel home theater service or front-and-center bedroom, office, or kitchen placement.These speakers are so small and lightweight that we questioned their ability to render even a facade of full-bodied sound. However, we were happily impressed. The Wharfedale 7.1s are detailed, effortless, warm, and punchy; what bass they can muster is firm and taut, like you'd want from a small speaker. Most speakers have trouble recreating the deep and woody sound of an acoustic upright bass; on the Diamond 7.1s, recordings of this instrument sound articulate and musical, if not necessarily six feet tall.The Diamond 7.1s sound best at medium-to-loud levels, but you do get more bass as you crank them up, and distortion doesn't seem to be a worry (see our accompanying FAQ for more on Wharfedale's antidistortion measures). The speakers are fairly dynamic, though they do compress a little under high-power, bass-heavy material. They also sound a little piercing at the level where the low end sounds right for rock listening--in this respect the removable grilles help, so if you're going to listen loudly, leave 'em on.Imaging is good, and the Diamond 7.1s offer a good sense of low-level ambient detail, especially with ambient recordings commonly found on classical CDs. Often small speakers, even very good ones, will really dry up ambient recordings--that is, shrink the perceived room size where the musical performance is taking place. This is largely because so many bookshelf speakers have little deep bass, and many ambient or spatial cues live in low tones and in room resonances that make up the atmosphere of a recording, rather than in specific musical tones.If pressed to name shortcomings, we'd say the Diamond 7.1s' high frequencies are not as smooth or effortless in quality as those from pricier speakers and are a little too pronounced (emphasizing, for instance, the tape hiss present on CDs mastered from analog tapes). And the bass, for all its pleasing qualities, is a little muddier than one would want in an ideal speaker. But considering the per-dollar level of quality here, these quibbles are easily forgiven.For a budget sound system or merely a compact, secondary-use pair, we highly recommend Wharfedale's Diamond 7.1 bookshelf speakers.--Michael MikesellPros:Great soundWell suited to different musical stylesSmall sizeRemarkably deep bass outputQuality designCan be used with banana-plug-terminated speaker cableCons:Slightly muddy low endSlightly pronounced high frequencies",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4197YJ7MHZL._SX300_.jpg,134.5,,Electronics,Home Audio,Stereo Components,Speakers,Speaker Systems,
Wharfedale Emerald 93 Bookshelf Speakers (Real Rosewood Veneer) (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"Wharfedale's Emerald 93 is a jewel of a bookshelf speaker. Built by one of England's most celebrated manufacturers, the two-way speakers employ a pair of superb speaker cones as well as other key component parts for a sound best described as ""musical."" Their sound is impressive--open, warm, and natural--and consistently conveys the essence or ""soul"" of the music.That said, the Emerald 93s are handsome, well-fashioned speakers. Both the rosewood andoakmodels are cased in gorgeous, real-wood veneer with black grilles. Just below and running parallel with the angular grille base runs a wedge carved into the cabinet itself. This subtle yet striking cosmetic touch sets the Emerald 93s apart from less fashion-conscious speakers.But let's talk about what'sinsidethose cabinets.A 6-inch, mineral-loaded polymer woofer handles the bass frequencies and the critical midrange, where 80 percent of the music takes place. Wharfedale's quick-response woofer gets its rigidity from finely crushed stone, which Wharfedale presses into the polymer during the molding process. This outstanding driver crosses over to 1-inch, silk-dome high-frequency driver, certainly one of the sweetest tweeters we know of.In addition to being a looker, the Emerald 93s boast a rigid cabinet that's free of resonant coloration. Both deep bass and speaker sensitivity (how loaded it sounds with a given voltage input) are enhanced by a rear-firing port, which means that the Emerald 93s require some distance from the rear wall (about two feet or so) to perform at its best. We also recommend a pair of sturdy, 24-inch-high stands to get the most from these speakers.The Emerald 93s' sound is exquisite. Vocals are so present it's like having the singer in front of you. A grand piano, one of the hardest of all instruments to reproduce, is full and sonorous, with layers of complex harmonics and a gorgeous tone, while electric guitars ring with the texture and crunch of real life.The Emerald 93s' bass sounds punchy and warm, reaching down to an honest 50 Hz with a beautiful roundness. Bowed acoustic basses growl, and drums rock with a sense of real weight behind them. And the tweeter is, again, a marvel--extended, detailed, and sweet.What else is there to say? Wharfedale's Emerald 93s are remarkable speakers. They're also a remarkable value. If you truly love music and want to hear its subtlety, nuance, and bouquet of tone colors marvelously reproduced, these are speakers you'll cherish.--Wayne GarciaPros:Extremely detailed and natural soundSuperb driversGreat cosmetics and construction qualityBi-wire and bi-amp readyCons:Not much bass below 50 Hz",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Q11DMKZHL._SX300_.jpg,134.5,,Electronics,Home Audio,Stereo Components,Speakers,Bookshelf Speakers,

Wharfedale Emerald 97 3-Way Floorstanding Speakers (Real Oak Veneer),"Great speakers keep getting more affordable. It used to be, a first-rate speaker entailed a second mortgage on the house. The eminent British manufacturer Wharfedale, however, debuts its amazing, biwireable/biampable Emerald line with an astonishingly high quality-to-price ratio.The Emerald 97 three-way floorstanding speakers, also available inrosewood, occupy minimal floor space while gracing any room with their gorgeous sound and glossy, real-wood finish. Their treble and midrange drivers render voices and acoustic instruments so seductively that you'd swear the performers were right in front of you.And while Wharfedale is best known among stereo purists, two pairs of Emerald 97s (or a pair of 97s withEmerald 93s for surrounds) work beautifully with theEmerald Centreto fill a room with surround sound from DVDs or DTS-encoded 5.1-channel music CDs.Positioning, often a chore with floorstanding speakers, is a snap with these, in part because the Emerald 97s are so light (about 35 pounds each). They sound best with space on all sides: at least two feet from the walls and seven from each other. Setting them closer to the walls isn't disastrous, however, so if you're tight on space just be prepared for an overemphasized bottom end. We prefer toeing these speakers into the listening position as opposed to strict parallel placement, but toed or not, the Emerald 97s fill a room with pleasing, uncolored sound.A subwoofer does help drive home the bottom octave (40 Hz and under) with greater solidity--especially with action films and rock music--but the Emerald 97s are capable of very deep bass on their own thanks to a well-designed (and unobtrusive) port in the front panel.It's easy to rave about a speaker's extended range (high to low), especially when a speaker commands a wide frequency range, as the Emerald 97 does. But what really makes this speaker special is the quality of its silk-dome tweeters and their integration with not one but two nearly 7-inch woofers. The high frequencies sound sweet and open, to be sure, but the midrange--mostly embodying voices and any melodic instruments--sounds as warm and natural as can be.Sometimes speakers that excel in the midrange sound their best only with certain music, like folk or acoustic jazz. Not so the Emerald 97s. From Haydn to Hendrix, Nina Simone to Nine Inch Nails, these speakers do perfect justice to the music--and, it seems, with ease.The Emerald 97s sound better with their grilleson, which is unusual in our experience. This is unfortunate, as the grilles obscure the speakers' glorious woodwork. Like all hi-fi, however, you should season to taste--if your amplifier or receiver leans dark (with slightly diminished treble sound) or if your taste tends bright, you may prefer the grilles off.Rock fans and movie buffs may still want a subwoofer for extra low-end slam, but a good amp with a biwired hookup (see our FAQ for more on biwiring) brings these babies close to perfection all on their very own.--Michael MikesellPros:Amazing frequency extension (highs and lows)Gorgeous midrangeHigh sensitivity (easy to drive)Beautiful wood finishEasy to positionSounds good from anywhere in the roomBiwire/biamp convenienceFloor spikes includedCons:Slightly muddy deep bass",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41SFNA7TCYL._SY300_.jpg,134.5,,Electronics,Home Audio,Stereo Components,Speakers,Floorstanding Speakers,

Wharfedale Emerald 97 3-Way Floor-Standing Speakers (Rosewood) (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"With a performance as inviting as its classical good looks, the Emerald, now in its third generation, is an exceptionally refined speaker. Designed with a distinctly art deco feel, the speakers from the new Emerald range are built into a real wood cabinet, producing a rich, warm sound.Although undisclosed by the appearance of the Emeralds, technology was used extensively in its development. Complex computer modeling has been used in the design of the cabinets to minimize coloration, the woofer cones are constructed using Wharfedale's patented mineral-loaded homopolymer plastic to dampen unwanted resonances while retaining the strength to keep bass accurate and dynamic. Finally, laser interferometry has been used to create a truly outstanding tweeter. The end result is a classic amongst speakers--a dry acoustic character with a revealing and flawless transparency.Unlike most speaker manufacturers, Wharfedale still designs its own unique drive units, continuing an unbroken tradition of over 65 years. During that time Wharfedale was a pioneer in almost every aspect of drive unit technology including fabric surrounds, rubber surrounds, molded cones, polypropylene cones, ceramic magnets, plastic dome, and ceramic dome tweeters. For this outstanding product line Wharfedale has introduced a new woofer which uses an exclusive mineral loaded homopolymer plastic which we first patented in 1982. Not only is this cone rigid but the finely ground mineral embedded in the cone damps out any unwanted resonances.It is often said that the design of tweeters owes more to art that science. Certainly tiny changes in materials, construction, and dimensions can make all the difference between reproducing a clean natural treble or creating the coloration and distortion that degrades the sound reproduction. At Wharfedale, though, we have turned an art into a science. Using the advanced technology of laser interferometry and computer driven analysis we have been able to build on the experience of designing literally hundreds of tweeter units. The optimization of the component parts including the silk-fabric dome and the Ferrofluid-cooled voice coil has created an outstanding tweeter worthy of the Wharfedale tradition of finest sound quality.In the Wharfedale Emerald series the tweeter is integrated into a circular horn flare, which controls the dispersion of high frequencies in both the vertical and horizontal planes. It is this design that contributes to the true Emerald nature of these loudspeakers with their dry acoustic character and their revealing transparency. Many hours of complex computer analysis has ensured that these cabinet designs are acoustically inert and so add minimal coloration and distortions to the musical performance.The Emerald 97 model can be converted to biwiring following the removal of two links. Two separate pairs of cables are then run from the amplifier outputs to separately feed the bass/mid drive units and the tweeters. The result is a cleaner, more open sound that, with a good system, amply justifies the extra cost of the cables.With a power rating of 125 watts, a sensitivity of 89 dB, and a nominal impedance of 8 ohms, these speakers will work well with the more powerful home theater amplifiers on the market. The Wharfedale Emerald 97 comes in a real rosewood veneer and has a five-year parts and labor warranty.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/419TKHDCQYL._SY300_.jpg,134.5,,Electronics,Home Audio,Stereo Components,Speakers,Floorstanding Speakers,

Fisher Price Tuff Stuff Tape Recorder,"This colorful, kiddy recorder is solid, durable, and has a wide, textured handle. Unfortunately,  it's still mediocre after considering its engineering. It's top-heavy, yet has a flimsy cassette door which  may be problematic if there's a lot of toppling (likely with preschoolers). The machine has all the functions  of other toy tape players, including large buttons, icons, and a karaoke microphone. The tradeoffs: rewind  and forward buttons must be held down to work, and the record button is hard to press down (all tedious  during song repeats). The microphone is attached by a fairly short cord, which means some kids will have  to carry the heavy, clunky machine, or sit down, to use it properly. The microphone itself offers limited  amplification, but kids will still love elevating their voices above the music. The sound quality is very  good, even stereophonic when headphones are employed. There are adapter jacks for headphones and AC  power, but parents will have to buy these accessories separately. The recorder requires four C batteries (not  included).--Diane Beall",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41VGXWPDQXL._SX300_.jpg,44.99,,Electronics,Portable Audio & Video,Cassette Players & Recorders,,,

The HT-9930 brings together a center-channel and two rear-channel speakers for less than $100, a bargain any way you cut it.The HT-9930's two unobtrusive satellite speakers come with keyhole-shaped slots for easy wall mounting. Removing the grilles reveals 4-inch woofers with small ""whizzer"" cones for added midrange detail as well as a 0.625-inch piezoelectric tweeter. The center channel sports an identical tweeter and is flanked by two similar but slightly larger (4.25-inch) woofers. The black enclosures are quite attractive and belie this system's modest price.And, for the money, the HT-9930 sounds surprisingly good. Vocals, the most important element for a center-channel speaker to reproduce, sound well-balanced and natural. The center channel exhibits a slight--and, at this price, unavoidable--boxiness, however, and lacks the ability to render subtle aural details.The satellites sound nearly identical to the center channel but are not quite as rich or full-bodied due to their single, small woofers. But they perform atmospheric surround-sound duty with ease, carving out a large, three-dimensional soundfield.With the HT-9930, KLH has funneled its years of speaker-making experience into a remarkably good little add-on home-theater rig.

The LCD includes a battery indicator, message number, folder location, and minute counter. While performing specific operations, such as erase, lock, record, and play, the LCD displays additional icons related to these functions.The MB002 can record automatically by voice activation (VOX). Alternatively, you can record a message manually by pressing the record button, and then pressing the record button again to stop recording. Press the play button to listen to your messages. You can skip messages during playback by pressing the search button twice. When you skip, the recorder beeps and the message counter changes. To play back only the first 5 seconds of each message, use the Intro function for quick scanning. The MB002 has two folders (A and B), and each can store up to 8 minutes of recordings. You can erase messages one at a time or an entire folder at once, or prevent erasure with the lock feature. The recorder also includes volume adjustment and an earphone jack.In our tests of the MB002, we found the optimal recording distance was between 1 inch and 2 feet from the microphone. Sound quality was only adequate, as recorded voices were sometimes unclear. In these cases, words sounded fuzzy but were still comprehensible. To test the VOX feature, we pressed the mode button until the VOX icon appeared in the LCD, as the instructions directed. We pressed the search button to turn on the VOX function and pressed the mode button again to set it. However, despite repeated attempts, we were unable to turn on the VOX function. We do not know if the instructions contained an error or if our test unit was defective.--Emily BakkoPros:Intuitive function icons on LCDLightweight, compact sizeCan scan first 5 seconds of messagesCons:No LCD backlightSound was fuzzy in some tests",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41VZ4AF4ZXL._SY300_.jpg,23.95,Memorex,Electronics,Portable Audio & Video,Digital Voice Recorders,,,

Handspring Wireline 33.6 Modem Springboard Module,"Connect to your PC using a standard phone line, synchronize data while  you're traveling, or check e-mail and surf the Web--all from your Handspring  Visor handheld with the Handspring modem module.To set up the modem module,  we inserted the included AAA batteries, removed the slot protector from the  Handspring Visor, inserted the module into the Visor, connected the phone line,  and ran the modem setup program. Installation was quick, easy, and intuitive,  requiring only about three minutes.To use the modem module, you'll need to  install, set up, and run communication software. Unfortunately, the modem module  doesn't come with software, so you'll have to download your own--a truly  surprising and disappointing omission by Handspring. However, Handspring does  make the process of locating software easy. We visited www.handspring.com,  followed links to software, and downloaded a trial version of MultiMail PRO from  ActualSoft. You may want to read reviews of communication software in your  favorite handheld periodical to determine what software title is best for  you.MultiMail PRO comes with configuration settings for AT&amp;T World Net,  CompuServe, EarthLink, Netcom, Shore, MindSpring, and the IBM Global Network.  With this software, connecting our Visor to the Internet to check e-mail was as  easy as entering a phone number, account name, and password. However, we were  not able to connect our Visor to an alternate ISP whose settings were not  preconfigured. (Obviously, we cannot fault Handspring for the limitations of  third-party software, but we do fault them for not including software at  all.)If you want to stay connected while you're on the road, the 33.6 Kbps  modem module is a must-have accessory.--Mike BrownPros:Easy to set up and useConnects your Handspring Visor to the Internet via an ordinary phone lineCons:No communication software included",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/416E07ACXAL._SX300_.jpg,49.95,Handspring,Electronics,Computers & Accessories,Networking Products,Modems,,

It plays DVDs and CDs, so even if you're not inclined to use the DVDC600 for marathon movie sessions, this versatile carousel player is great for playing music CDs.The DVDC600 outputs Dolby Digital and DTS signals. The player incorporates a 10-bit video digital-to-analog converter and a 96 kHz, 24-bit audio digital-to-analog converter for superior sound and images. It also has a dynamic range compression switch for late-night listening, as well as a 3-D sound mode for a simulated surround effect.Other features include 2x audio scan, parental lock, and black-level expansion for superior video contrast. The DVDC600 also offers a disc view feature, which displays the beginning scene of each DVD track or chapter. You can also display nine views simultaneously with the index view feature.The front panel is very extensive. In addition to open, exchange, and disc skip buttons, you can program, clear, and activate random play from the front-panel buttons. The front panel also incorporates play/pause, track skip, and stop buttons. There's also a jog-shuttle dial in the upper right corner, which enables you to advance DVDs with ease from frame to frame. A small LED light indicates when the player is in standby mode. Five lights to the left of the main display indicate which of the five discs is currently in play mode.The main display is as impressive as the front-panel controls. A Saturn-like icon lights up to show which disc is playing. Another indicator shows whether it's a DVD, audio, or video CD. Logos for DTS and Dolby Digital indicate the format. The main display shows disc title, chapter, and elapsed time. It also shows whether the repeat function is on. There's also an icon showing whether the parental lock function is active. Finally, a grid of squares shows the tracks or chapters for a given disc.The rear panel offers coaxial and optical digital-audio outputs; unfortunately, they're very close together, which poses a problem for some cables with extra-wide plugs. In addition to the digital-audio outputs, the DVDC600 has two pairs of analog stereo outputs. Samsung thoughtfully provides two composite-video outputs, plus an S-Video out and a set of component-video jacks.The full-function joystick-style remote control is smartly laid out, with the main functions arranged like spokes around a wheel in the center. The enter button rests in the middle as part of the joystick, which is less finicky than most joystick remotes. Three large buttons above the joystick offer access to the player's functions and the DVD disc menu. Below the joystick, you'll find quick-access buttons for audio, subtitle, and camera angle. Large play, pause, and stop buttons are centrally located and easy to find, as are the chapter skip, fast-forward, and rewind buttons. The universal remote control can also be programmed to operate most TVs, and has buttons for channel skip, volume, and channel number keys, which can also be used to program discs.An oversize platter slides open with the touch of the remote or front-panel button, enabling you to load your favorite discs. An exchange button allows you to load discs while a DVD or CD is playing without interrupting the movie or music.Although you can play random discs through the DVDC600, like other multidisc DVD players, it does not allow you to play random tracks from disc to disc.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31BCV89MZQL._SX300_.jpg,145.95,,Electronics,Television & Video,DVD Players & Recorders,DVD Players,,

ReplayTV 3030 Digital Video Recorder,"ReplayTV's 3030 server provides up to 30 hours of storage space and offers a host of upgrades, including an advanced programmable remote control with a ReplayZones button that makes it very easy to find the shows you want to record. In fact, it's almost too easy. Once we grew accustomed to recording shows in advance, we found ourselves watching three times as much TV as we had in the past.For those unfamiliar with the concept of TV servers, ReplayTV records programs digitally and stores the information on a hard drive. Like a VCR, if you want to record your favorite show while you're away from home, you can store it on the 3030's hard drive and watch it later. Unlike VCRs, the personal TV server doesn't require tapes or other media to store programming.It's important to point out that the actual amount of storage space depends on the video-recording quality that you select. A higher quality picture will take up more storage space than a lower quality recording. At the lowest setting, the picture quality is still better than standard VHS. At the middle setting, the picture quality is better than an S-VHS VCR, but storage capacity decreases by approximately 40 percent. The highest-quality setting approaches 500 lines of resolution (depending on the source) but further reduces storage capacity. We recommend using the highest setting for movies and the middle level for sporting events, sitcoms, and other programs, then erasing the content immediately after viewing it. Before doing so, however, you may want to consider taping it with a VCR for your VHS library.One of the coolest features on the 3030 server is the ability to pause a live broadcast and resume watching it if you're interrupted for any number of reasons. When you utilize this feature, ReplayTV acts as a time buffer by storing the show in memory so you can pick up the program from where you left off. A ""Return to Live"" button on the remote allows you to skip forward to real time, which is great if you're watching a sporting event and you wish to catch up to the live action.There's also an ""Instant Replay"" button on the remote that allows you to rewatch portions of a show or sporting event in 7-second increments, so you're not limited to rewatching only a brief segment.ReplayTV also allows you to personalize programming for a specific theme. For example, you can set ReplayTV to monitor TV listings for any program featuring a specific actor. You can also refine theme-based searches of programming. For instance, if you wish to recordFriends, you can limit your search to title only, so you won't waste time pulling up every movie and talk show that has the word ""friends"" in the description.ReplayTV's onscreen guide appears with a blue background and white characters that are very readable. Since you'll be using the guide a lot to search for programs and to preview descriptions, it's important that you can read the text on a standard-size TV from your sofa. ReplayTV's onscreen guide gets an A+ in this regard.We loved ReplayTV's QuickSkip feature, which allows you to instantly jump ahead 30 seconds, so you can skip through TV commercials on prerecorded programs. We also like the ReplayZones, which make it very easy to find programs that suit your tastes by searching according to genre. ReplayTV delineates programming into a wide variety of categories, from action and romance movies to cooking and home-improvement shows--and everything in between. ReplayTV also offers a Search Zone that allows you to input words such as ""love"" or ""vacation"" using the remote control and an onscreen keypad.If you wish to save a particular prerecorded show, you can record it on to a VCR using the back-panel outputs. We were impressed by ReplayTV's inclusion of two sets of audio-video inputs and outputs, as well an S-video input and output. This enables users to hook up a DSS or other direct-broadcast satellite receiver to the 3030, along with a VCR as an output device.You can watch one program while recording another by using a cable TV splitter. Simply connect the cable from the wall to the splitter's input line, then connect a spare coaxial cable from the splitter's output line to the 3030, and another from the splitter to the TV. To watch a show while recording another, use the TV button on the Replay remote to switch sources (assuming you've input your TV brand's infrared code into Replay's universal remote control).One neat feature we really like is the ability to place the 3030 into ""quiet mode"" simply by turning off the unit. This keeps the server from automatically recording shows to the hard drive, which conserves power and keeps the hard disc from spinning, thereby keeping the unit cool and noise free. If you happen to be recording a show when you turn the 3030 off, it will continue to record, then shut down once the show is finished and stored in the hard drive.Connecting the 3030 to our home theater system took about 15 minutes. Replay thoughtfully provides a poster-size chart to guide users through setup without opening the manual. If you have an open phone jack, we recommend using it. Otherwise, you can use the supplied splitter to connect the 3030 to an existing line. (You do not need a dedicated phone line, since ReplayTV's programming updates take place in the early morning hours, for only a few minutes each night.) Or you can purchase a 56 Kbps wireless transmitter/receiver, which plugs into a wall outlet and allows you to connect the 3030 to an existing phone line across the room or in another part of the house.Dialing into ReplayTV to download the free programming guide was much easier than we expected. One major advantage to ReplayTV is that it doesn't charge any monthly service fee for downloading the program guide.We like the fact that ReplayTV's service is nonintrusive. After all, the whole concept of personal TV servers is intended to liberate viewers so they can watch the programs they prefer, whenever they feel like it. ReplayTV is designed to make it as easy as possible for customers to find the programs they like and to record them for future enjoyment.Pros:30-hour hard driveEasy-to-navigate onscreen guideIntuitive remote controlFree programming guideCons:No internal fan to cool unit",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31GYXZB44KL._SX300_.jpg,134.5,,Electronics,Television & Video,Streaming Media Players,,,

The camera then constructs a sophisticated 14-segment  metering pattern around the subject and makes slight adjustments to set the  correct exposure.With a unique eye-start operation, the Maxxum XTsi provides  an instant response to any situation. When the camera is brought to the eye, the  autofocus and auto exposure systems are activated automatically, without having  to touch the shutter-release button. You can also select several shooting modes,  including portrait, landscape, close-up, sports/action, and night portrait mode.  In aperture priority mode, the camera's system will automatically select the  correct shutter speed when you choose an aperture. In shutter priority mode, you  can select any shutter speed and the XTsi will set the best lens aperture.  However, if you prefer, the Maxxum XTsi is also manually adjustable. This is  ideal in unusual shooting conditions.The built-in flash provides coverage to  28mm, with synch speeds up to 1/125 seconds. It features a red-eye reduction  preflash and can be used in all exposure modes. With continuous film advance,  you can shoot up to two frames per second, so you'll catch all the action. You  have a choice of regularly framed shots or panorama format pictures, and date  imprinting can be switched on or off as desired.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/411HS5DRSPL._SX300_.jpg,134.5,,Electronics,Camera & Photo,Film Photography,Film Cameras,SLR Cameras,
Philips CDR785BK 3-CD Integrated CD Recorder (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"Philips' CDR785BK CD recorder offers karaoke and full CD-changer performance, making it a useful CDplayeras well as a fun, convenient recorder. Whether you're shuffling songs between the four decks (three playback trays and one record tray), drawing songs from three decks to record on the fourth, or recording your own voice over instrumental karaoke backing tracks, the CDR785BK is one potent, music-making machine.The CDR785BK is equally happy receiving data from either of the two established means of digital audio transmission (optical or coaxial), and its analog inputs let you feed the recorder from external devices such as a cassette deck or a turntable--though a turntable must first be routed through a phono preamplifier, such as the phono input on a receiver.You can customize your CDs by recording at either normal or double speed from any or all of the three player decks to the recorder deck. Double-speed recording can only take place during internal digital dubbing, however. CDs made from analog or external digital sources--or discs made from copies of digital recordings (see the accompanying FAQ for more detail)--must be made at single speed.All recording falls into one of four categories. In any category, the process is the same: first you select the type of recording you'll be making, then you hit Record--it's pretty much that simple.With high-speed (2x) recording and automatic finalizing (preparing it for use in standard CD players), the CDR785BK will make a CD from another CD or from a programmed sequence, initiating simultaneous recording and playback and then finalizing the finished CD (please see the accompanying FAQ for more detail on finalizing). No sound can be heard while the recorder is operating at double speed.Alternately, you can opt for the second recording mode, high-speed recording, which lets you add subsequent music before finalizing--perfect for recording short albums that let you add extra songs at the end, or for making compilations on a track-by-track basis, when you're not sure what goes on until you record it. You can even isolate a segment of a track and record that.The third recording option is normal-speed recording, which allows you to hear what you're recording while you're recording it, whether it's a whole CD, a track, a program, or a track segment. We found this mode captures the sound most faithful to the source recording.Lastly, the CDR785BK lets you record the sound of your own (or someone else's!) voice, with or without mixed-in music accompaniment. Any microphone with a quarter-inch jack will work here, and the CDR785BK lets you adjust the relative level of voice to music.A headphone jack is a huge convenience, and Philips thoughtfully stations a volume control alongside it.The only real drawback is the absence of a fade-in/-out button, whose absence forces you to record from the analog inputs and perform manual fades if you want smooth transitions between cuts from live albums or if you want to squeeze a three-minute song onto the end of a disc with only 2:45 remaining.In our view, however, the many conveniences far outweigh the unit's shortcomings. With karaoke, the ability to alter the level of the digital input, the ability to alter the balance between the left and right channels, and the presence of a safety feature called automatic level control (which prevents incoming analog signals from exceeding the maximum signal level), you'll have nearly unparalleled freedom to customize your music.--Michael MikesellPros:Can be used as a 4-disc changer for playback and programmingConvenient recording of tracks from 3 discs to 1High-quality analog-to-digital convertersHigh-speed dubbingHeadphone jack with volume controlCons:No fade-in/-out command",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41HMTP03S9L._SX300_.jpg,134.5,,Electronics,Home Audio,Stereo Components,CD Players & Recorders,CD Recorders,

GPX FRS200 2-Mile 14-Channel FRS Two-Way Radio,"The GPX FRS200 has more features than most radios in its class,  including support for 14 channels and 38 subcodes, a call button, a two-mile  range, and a backlit LCD. It's an easy-to-use FRS radio with a value price.The FRS200 was up and running as soon as we popped in the requisite four AAA  batteries. In our tests, the radio's sound quality was excellent. Its range was  comparable to that of most FRS radios we've tested--one mile under average  conditions, two miles under ideal conditions. Unfortunately, we ran into a few  snags when we tested some of the radio's more advanced features. The call  button, supposedly used to transmit a short call tone to others tuned to the  same channel, transmitted nothing but static. Another feature that emits a short  beep when the talk button is released (to let the others in your group know that  you've finished transmitting) was more annoying than useful. Also, the radio's  button layout is cumbersome. For example, the backlight button is integrated  with the push-to-talk button and is far too easy to press accidentally. Finally,  switching channels was more difficult than it should have been because the up  button is recessed.The FRS200 is a little thicker than an average FRS radio, but overall it's  compact and fits nicely in your hand. The construction of the FRS200 isn't as  good as that of the more expensive radios, nor is its overall design, but with  such a low price, these tradeoffs are expected. The radio supports all 14  channels assigned to FRS use, along with 38 subcodes per channel, so you  shouldn't have trouble finding an available frequency.Overall, if you can live with the FRS200's minor faults, we think you'll find it  a surprisingly good bargain.--T.

Cobra MicroTalk FRS305 2-Mile 14-Channel FRS Water-Resistant Two-Way Radio (Winter Moss),"The last thing you want to hear on a hunting trip or a hiking trail is a beeping radio. Yet you still want to stay in contact for company or in case of emergency. The Cobra FRS 305 microTALK radio solves this problem with its innovative vibrating alert for incoming calls. Instead of a tone, you receive a silent notice that someone is trying to reach you.The vibrating alert is only one of the Cobra FRS 305 microTALK's handy features that make this two-way radio a must-have for active, outdoorsy types and busy families. This radio is made for outdoor use with a waterproof casing in winter moss for a stylish silver finish.With Family Radio Service (FRS), you can give each family member a radio and not have to worry about cell phone coverage or expensive roaming charges. Reach anyone instantly with the touch of a button or make announcements to everyone in your group at the same time.What is Family Radio Service? In 1996, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) set aside one part of the FM radio frequency spectrum for use by small groups at short ranges. Use of this UHF range--from 462.5625 to 467.7125 MHz--is free and doesn't require an FCC license. (GMRS, or General Mobile Radio Service, does require an FCC license.)Cobra's microTALK radios come with features that make using FRS simple and enjoyable. The Cobra FRS 305 features an automatic squelch that prevents the radio from activating until a voice signal is received. With squelch, you won't hear random popping and hissing from other electronic devices or atmospheric signals.This radio comes with all 14 available FRS channels plus 38 CTCSS subchannels, or privacy codes, per channel. CTCSS codes are actually tones that ""code"" and ""decode"" a signal, allowing the people in your group to transmit on the same channel without having to listen to other radio traffic on the same channel. Note that these privacy codes won't keep others from listening to you--FRS users without a CTCSS code-enabled radio can still hear your transmissions. (For more about privacy codes, see ourTwo-Way Radio Buying Guide.)The channel scan feature allows you to search available frequencies for a clear channel and monitor activity from other transmitting radios. The keypad lock prevents accidental pressing of buttons, and the call key lets you signal anyone in your party with a distinctive tone.Serious outdoor lovers considering an investment in Family Radio Service should consider the features, power, and versatility of the Cobra FRS 305.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31AXDZZ36DL._SY300_.jpg,134.5,,Electronics,Portable Audio & Video,CB & Two-Way Radios,Two-Way Radios,,

Cobra MicroTalk FRS115 2-Mile 14-Channel FRS Two-Way Radio (Frosty Maraschino),"You'd be hard-pressed to find an FRS radio that packs as many features into such a compact and attractive package as Cobra's FRS115 Microtalk. In addition to having a multitude of advanced communications features, the Microtalk is the only radio in Cobra's line capable of picking up AM and FM signals. This allows you to listen to stereo broadcasts via headphones attached to the integrated headphone jack. Incoming FRS broadcasts temporarily disrupted the AM or FM reception, which enabled us to listen to our favorite tunes and talk radio programs without missing an important transmission from a member of our group.The product's design is as sensible as it is colorful, incorporating a flexible rubber antenna instead of hard plastic. The unit's many buttons are easily accessible yet difficult to push by accident, and there's a channel-lock feature that comes in handy when inquisitive kids (or clumsy friends) are entrusted with the radio.A call button can be pushed to make other FRS radios tuned to your frequency ""ring,"" alerting others in your party that you are about to make a transmission. There are independent buttons for adjusting the unit's volume and selecting channels, along with a microphone jack that can be used with a separately available headset to allow for true hands-free operation.The Microtalk did a great job in our tests, with a range comparable to that of other FRS units and decent audio quality from the built-in speaker. We ditched the included headphones, as their hard plastic design made them uncomfortable, and used a pair of compact earbuds instead. We expected AM and FM reception to be limited, but it was pulling in signals in a basement office that even standalone portable radios we've tested couldn't tune. A handy seek feature simplifies tuning, and memory presets keep our favorite stations within easy reach.If the included headphones were only better, this would be a near-perfect FRS radio. But even with that slight oversight, the Microtalk is a true standout in a crowded market.--Tracy BakerPros:Good range for picking up FRS transmissionsGreat AM/FM radio receptionCons:Included headphones are uncomfortable",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/316C55XBR0L._SY300_.jpg,35,,Electronics,Portable Audio & Video,CB & Two-Way Radios,Two-Way Radios,,
Cobra MicroTalk FRS220  2-Mile 14-Channel FRS Two-Way Radio (Charcoal),"Affordably priced and easy to use, Family Radio Service (FRS) two-way radios like the Cobra FRS 220 microTALK will give you peace of mind on your next hiking adventure, amusement park excursion, or trip to the mall. With an FRS radio, you can give each family member a radio and not have to worry about cell phone coverage or expensive roaming charges. Reach anyone instantly without dialing or make announcements to everyone in your group at the same time.What is Family Radio Service (FRS)? In 1996, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) set aside one part of the FM radio frequency spectrum for use by small groups at short ranges. Use of this UHF range--from 462.5625 to 467.7125 MHz--is free and doesn't require an FCC license. (GMRS, or General Mobile Radio Service, does require an FCC license.)When using an FRS radio, expect reception to be affected by the terrain--thick woods, buildings, and electrical sources will cut your range. However if you're transmitting to another radio from a mountaintop or other high point, you could reach someone up to two miles away.Cobra's microTALK radios come with features that make using FRS simple and enjoyable. The Cobra FRS 220 microTALK features an automatic squelch that prevents the radio from activating until a voice signal is received. With squelch, you won't hear random popping and hissing from other electronic devices or atmospheric signals. The keypad lock prevents accidental pressing of buttons, and the call key allows you to signal anyone in your party with a distinctive tone.This radio comes with all 14 available FRS channels plus 38 CTCSS subchannels, or ""privacy codes,"" per channel. CTCSS codes are actually tones that ""code"" and ""decode"" a signal, allowing the people in your group to transmit on the same channel without having to listen to other radio traffic on the same channel. Note that these privacy codes won't keep others from listening to you--FRS users without a CTCSS code-enabled radio will still hear your transmissions. (For more about privacy codes, see ourTwo-Way Radio Buying Guide.)Families looking for affordable and dependable communication should consider the power and versatility of the Cobra FRS 220 microTALK.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31S7FZ9C4QL._SY300_.jpg,29.62,,Electronics,Portable Audio & Video,CB & Two-Way Radios,Two-Way Radios,,

The electronic memory  remembers the last channel used, while the key lock, when activated, prevents  accidental channel change. Other convenient features include a backlit LCD  screen, a monitor function, and a headphone/speaker jack.The Cobra FRS310WX is powered by four AAA batteries (not included) or an  optional NiMH rechargeable battery (not included).

Plus, at only 7.9 ounces it won't weigh you down.This Stowaway keyboard is compatible with Handspring Visor handhelds running Palm OS v3.1 or later, including Visor Pro, Neo, Prism, Deluxe, and Platinum.

(To prepare the app for HotSync, simply add it to Install Tool on Windows, or Install Handheld Files in the Mac HotSync Manager.) Because the keyboard only needs power while it is actually being used, the effect on the overall battery life of your Visor will be minimal.To operate the keyboard with your handheld, click the Stowaway keyboard open from its folded position, lay it flat, and slide the keyboard parts together (it's separated into thirds for folding). Then, simply attach your handheld and start typing in a text-based program.You can do virtually all your work without taking your fingers off the keyboard with the Stowaway. The four custom keys on the right side of the keyboard (Date Book, Address, To Do List, and Memo Pad) are preprogrammed shortcut keys to activate certain applications, but they can be customized with the Keyboard application.Placing the keyboard on a firm, flat surface offers the best results, because of the folding design.

Fully automatic, its six different modes are easily adjusted using the mode dial switch on top of the camera, similar to dials often found on digital cameras. The various modes include fully automatic snap shooting for active subjects, portrait zoom, which maintains a constant subject size within the frame, continuous shooting for photos in sequence, spot shooting for one subject in a crowd, and landscape shooting for focus set to infinity.An LCD on top of the camera allows you to see which mode the camera is set to as well as how many exposures are left on the roll, current measurement of the zoom, flash setting, and if the self-timer has been turned on. There is a separate panorama switch between the zoom button and the diopter that narrows the picture area within the diopter when set. Loading film is extremely simple, and the roll automatically rewinds when finished. If you depress the shutter button halfway down, a blinking green light will turn on when your subject is in focus. The macro mode sets automatically if the subject is within about 4&nbsp;feet or closer.The Evoca 170SE has an attractive look and feel overall, although some may find it slightly bulky. The stylish front of the camera is a metallic silver, but be warned that the backing is gray plastic. It comes with its own camera case and is powered by one 3 volt lithium battery.

Leica Minilux 35mm Camera,"The Leica Minilux is a topnotch 35mm compact camera that boasts an  extremely attractive and durable titanium housing combined with a high-speed  Summarit 40mm lens. The Minilux is a little heavier than most compact cameras,  and is intended for the serious-minded amateur photographer who insists on the  very best. It offers an aperture priority mode, allowing you to manually set the  aperture before shooting your picture (the camera will automatically choose the  shutter speed). The Minilux also features either automatic or manual focusing.  The exposure meter is center-weighted for precise metering, and the built-in  flash fires automatically in low light. This camera is guaranteed to net you  impressive results and last nearly a lifetime.About Leica:Seventy-five years ago, the first Leica camera was introduced to the public at  the 1925 Leipzig Spring Fair. At the time, it was by far the most innovative  35mm camera ever produced (as well as one of the very first). Since then, no  camera in the world has been more widely acclaimed for continuously meeting the  highest standards of excellence in both optical precision and design  quality.Notably, many internationally acclaimed photographers such as Henri  Cartier-Bresson and Sebasti&atilde;o Salgado have used Leica cameras throughout  their careers. We think you'll find that Leica compact cameras maintain the same  integrity as the M and R models used by the pros, but at more affordable prices.  The lenses in all Leica 35mm cameras are still designed by the Leica optical  department in Solms, Germany. Every compact camera is also tested for quality in  Germany before being released.

Another feature that makes the Minilux Zoom stand out is a hot shoe mount  for the Leica CF flash unit (sold separately) in addition to the built-in flash.  This allows you to reduce red-eye and light up objects from a greater  distance.The Minilux Zoom also offers an active infrared autofocus or manual  focusing from about 28 inches to infinity. The exposure metering system is  center-weighted for extremely accurate exposures. Other outstanding features  include a self-timer with 10-second countdown indicated by a flashing red light,  tripod thread, data back for date imprinting, and an exposure value memory  function which allows you to calculate your exposure from an object that is not  in the center of your picture frame. The Minilux Zoom also has a number of  exposure and focus settings that allow for a great deal of creative control.

Philips CDR950BK CD Recorder (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"The Philips CDR950BK makes copies and compilations of your favorite music with incredible ease and a host of options.The Philips CDR950BK offers CD-R (write-once) and CD-RW (rewritable) compatibility and streamlined recording for single-track or whole-disc recordings. This CD recorder also offers 99-track programming, CD Text (for reading text-encoded artist and track information) and text-entry ability, so you can enter titles and artist names for discs as well as individual tracks. Multiple inputs (analog as well as coaxial and optical digital) and internal sample-rate conversion (to allow recording from DSS or DAT) expand your recording-source options, while a balance control lets you adjust the left/right input levels independently--even when making a digital recording (though you can't adjust the overall recording level when making a digital copy).As with all CD recorders, discs must be finalized before you can play them on standard nonrecording CD players. CD-RWs can be unfinalized and rerecorded (either by erasing the last track on the disc or the whole disc), while CD-Rs are permanent once they're finalized--you can't add any more material. More importantly, perhaps, you can never erase anything from a CD-R; once it's been recorded, it's permanent, whether you finalize the disc or not.Like most component CD recorders, the Philips CDR950BK uses the Serial Copy Management System, which prevents you from making a digital copy of a digital copy. It also means you must use DA-type (Digital Audio) CD-Rs and CD-RWs with this deck. Computer-grade or professional CD-Rs and CD-RWs will not work with this recorder (except for playback, and only if they've been finalized).Philips provides a one-year warranty for parts and labor.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31WFFTRKN8L._SX300_.jpg,134.5,,Electronics,Home Audio,Stereo Components,CD Players & Recorders,CD Recorders,

Sony DSC-S50 2MP Cyber-shot Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom,"The DSC-S50 CyberShot is a feature-packed, compact 2.1 megapixel camera with a 3x optical and 2x digital zoom. Like most Sony cameras, the S50 also comes with a long-life InfoLithium rechargeable battery. One unusual feature of this camera is its 2-inch color LCD screen, which swings up from the back of the camera and swivels more than 180 degrees. This lets you adjust the position of the display, compose self-portraits, and even swivel the LCD toward the inside of the camera for safe transportation. The display is clearer and brighter than those on most cameras--you can even use it in direct sunlight. Like many camcorders, this one lacks a traditional optical viewfinder--you compose your shots by using the color display.Maximum image size is 1,600 x 1,200 pixels, which produces good-quality prints even at sizes up to 8 by 10 inches. Pictures are stored on Sony's proprietary Memory Stick media (the camera ships with a 4 MB stick).Hobbyists will appreciate the wide range of manual controls, including shutter priority, aperture priority, manual focus, exposure compensation, and a number of special effects. The macro is particularly impressive, focusing on items less than 1.2 inches from the lens.This multimedia marvel also lets you make low-resolution (320 x 240 or 160 x 112) MPEG movies up to 60 seconds in length, and a built-in microphone can be used both for movie mode and to add sounds to your still photos.Pros:Long-life InfoLithium batteryAudio recordingMPEG movie modeExcellent macroCons:No optical viewfinder",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41RKMJJHYTL._SX300_.jpg,9.91,,Electronics,Camera & Photo,Digital Cameras,Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,,

One-touch  recording allows you to record up to eight hours of shows with the touch of a  single button.The auto DBS RecordLink allows satellite dish owners to synch  their DBS receiver to the VCR. This feature automatically runs the VCR in record  mode when you set your receiver to tape a program. The Philips VRB664AT will  then shut itself off when the program is over.Other features include a built- in MTS/SAP decoder, digital auto tracking for a clearer picture, auto clock set  with time-zone select, commercial skip, indefinite timer backup memory, and  front-panel access to most menu functions.

The unit's CD player uses a one-bit digital-to-analog audio converter for pristine sound, and audio CD-R/CD-RW compatibility means the box will play your home-brewed music mixes as well as prerecorded CDs.The CFD-ZW755 includes a digital AM/FM stereo tuner, too.

Bell Sonecor BE310VTR Micro-Cassette Voice and Telephone Recorder,"Reporters and other professionals who regularly record telephone interviews know what a pain it is to rig up a phone recording device. Many people attach special equipment to their regular tape recorders, a less-than-ideal solution that leaves a tangle of cords around your desk. If you're having these sorts of problems, it may be time to step up to something like Bell Sonecor's Microcassette Tele-Recorder.Like most recorders, this device has a microphone jack and headphone jack, but what sets it apart is the telephone handset jack. You use the included telephone cord to connect the recorder to the handset (or headset) jack on your telephone's base unit, and then connect the handset to the recorder. This is a great boon to those with multiline telephones, because most recording equipment can interface with only one of the lines. The Tele-Recorder records whichever line is in use at the time.The unit runs on a pair of AA batteries and also accepts 3-volt DC power although an AC adapter (which is not included). There are two selectable recording speeds that let you either get double the amount of time from your tapes or achieve better recording quality. A switch on the side lets you choose whether you want to record calls or play recordings back through the telephone. The unit includes voice-activated recording circuitry that can cut down on the amount of tape used and conserve battery power, but like all voice-activated technology, it tends to slightly clip off the first word that triggers it. The only thing we really didn't like about this device was the switch used to fast-forward and rewind tapes. It's important to be able to quickly rewind a few seconds of tape while transcribing, but this switch is stiff and locks into place too easily. Simple fast-forward and rewind cue buttons that don't lock down would be preferable. But, if you can live with that, then the Tele-Recorder provides one of the easiest and most convenient ways to add a recorder to your telephone.--T.

Sony DEJ715 CD Walkman (Grey),"Here's a cheering arrival for CD fans who've contemplated making a shift to a alternative music formats like MP3 just for the sake of skip-free performance. The D-EJ715 boasts Sony's new G-Protection circuitry, delivering a much higher level of resistance to jolts and jerks than any other CD portable we've ever encountered. You can jog with it. You can ski with it. You can skateboard with it. And the thing just keeps on playing perfectly.G-Protection is actually a combination of features--including a memory buffer and variable-speed platter (as found in many other CD and minidisc players) plus a specially refined, quick-reactive laser beam (unique to Sony) that rides out the jolts like nobody's business. Some other CD players with memory buffers cut the high frequency edge off the music, but not so in the G-Protection version. When this circuit is engaged, Sony's excellent CD sound quality remains intact.In the process of rethinking player mechanics, Sony has also downsized components and improved energy efficiency. That's why the D-EJ715 manages to be so slim (just 1 inch tall, 5.25 inches wide, and 5.625 inches deep) and lightweight (6.4 ounces, excluding accessories). That's also why it runs for so long.With the supplied rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries installed, you can enjoy up to 8 hours of playing time--that's with G-Protection engaged and the CD player placed on a flat and stable surface. (Not incidentally, these batteries recharge in the player in just three hours with the supplied AC adapter attached, a cute trick.)With a pair of AA batteries in place, the playing time shoots up to a maximum of 32 hours. (Early CD portables sucked all the juice out of four alkalines in just four hours.) The LCD screen on the lid of the D-EJ715 includes an icon that shows the remaining battery power.We also like that there's just one slot for installing either rechargeable or throwaway batteries on this model. On some other CD portables, including those that Sony manufactures, the on-board rechargeable cells are the slimmer ""stick"" variety. To add conventional battery playback on those models, you have to bolt-on or plug in an external battery carrying case--an accessory that's easy to forget and that adds bulk and clutter.If you're into the cost effectiveness and noble ecology of rechargeable batteries, Sony also offers a more expensive, nickel-metal hydride cell (the NH-WM2AA) that boasts significantly longer play time--18 hours max. (The cell is available through a phone number listed in the product literature.)Active users will also appreciate the rubbery, easily gripped carrying case with Velcro-adjustable hand strap and the new breed of sporty ""Street Style"" headphones supplied with the D-EJ715. Hooking over the ears, with the connecting band curving around the back of your head, these phones stay in place better than those ear bud varieties, have big drivers for better sound, and don't give you the ""helmet head"" look that comes with headphone bands that squish your hair.A small remote control is built into the two-segment headphone cable so you can easily change volume level, start the disc, or skip forward or backward through tracks while on the run. Return to ""play"" after hitting the full stop, and disc play resumes where it was interrupted. Smart. There's even a sliding ""hold"" switch on the remote, so you won't accidentally hit a button when it's stuffed in your shirt pocket. (A clip for securing the remote to your clothes would have been nice; but the remote is so small and light you'll hardly feel it flopping about.)A Digital Mega Bass option kicks up the musical thump--with the supplied headphones, it warmed the sound nicely on the first of two levels. The max setting, however, proved too boomy.Also included is an Automatic Volume Limiter System (AVLS). When engaged, it prevents the sound output through the headphone jack from ever getting too loud--guarding sensitive ears and preventing the inadvertent blocking of sirens, car horns, ringing phones, etc. We found AVLS cutoff point to be perfect for listening in a quiet environment, but it was set too low for situations where there's a fair amount of ambient noise--for example, from passing traffic. And the AVLS is not adjustableSony has thought of almost everything with the D-EJ715. There's even a combined optical digital-analog output jack for connecting this player to a home stereo system or digital recorder (like minidisc) to make your own music mixes.For both on-the-go and at-home play, this CD Walkman is highly recommended.Pros:Excellent antiskip protectionLong play times with both rechargeable and alkaline batteriesFine audio performanceFirst-rate ergonomics and supercompact, lightweight packagingCons:Auto-volume limiter is not adjustableNH rechargeable batteries last longer than the supplied ni-cad typeTight-gripping earphones must be removed to put on eyeglassesRemote control lacks a clothing clip",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31KQ8QWNCVL._SX300_.jpg,81.1,,Electronics,Portable Audio & Video,Portable CD Players,,,

It features 14 channels with 38 CTCSS and 83 DCS privacy codes (totaling 1,694 code and channel combinations), enabling you to easily switch to the clearest channel for communication.The power-save circuit automatically places the radio in a sleep mode if no signal has been transmitted or received for several seconds. A backlit LCD screen displays all 12 functions, including the channel, privacy code, battery strength, and key-lock status.

Other benefits to enjoy are hands-free operation (just set the VOX sensitivity level) and a babysitter mode (also voice activated).We found that replacing the unit's back after battery replacement was a bit tricky, and the hinged rubber jack covers (for microphone and earphone/headset) are vulnerable to damage.

Philips EXP103 eXpanium Portable MP3-CD Player with 45-Second Anti-Skip and Car Kit,"This sharp-looking unit is one of the first in a new generation of devices  able to play traditional audio CDs as well as MP3 audio files burned onto CD-R or  CD-RW discs. Although we maintain a few caveats with the Philips eXpanium's somewhat  clunky design, we were pleased with its sonic performance.In our tests, it took anywhere from 20 seconds to a minute to create a directory  from an MP3-encoded CD, depending on the number of files on the disc.  Once it was playing, though, the quality of sound was quite good.  The dynamic range was more than adequate: the high end was crisp and clean,  and the low tones were solid, even without the bass boost activated.The antishock system was virtually infallible when playing MP3s. We suppose that if we'd  dropped the player down a long set of wooden steps, it might have skipped, but short of that,  the music kept on coming, ignoring our jolts and bumps. It didn't hold up quite as well for  normal audio CDs (or CD-Rs or CD-RWs encoded with real-time tracks), but the antishock  protection for them was still very good. However, while Philips claims that the shock  protection is good for 45 seconds on audio CDs and up to 100 seconds for MP3s, the player took  what seemed an inordinate amount of time to recover after skipping.Navigating through and within CD tracks was straightforward, but in MP3 format the unit  provided no way to search within a track. The display was relatively difficult to read,  lacked a backlight, and did not display the track names on MP3 files. Additionally, the  display's dimness and placement at the back of the lid made the unit hard to use in a dark car.Overall, the eXpanium currently leads the way in what will likely be the next big portable  audio format, and it's only a matter of time before they package the technology in a slightly  sleeker, more user-friendly design.Pros:Utilizes cutting-edge MP3/CD technologyCrisp and clean high-end sound and solid low tonesNicely packaged with a pair of small earbud headphones and a car kitCons:Hard-to-read displayLong skip-recovery timeLacked ability to search within a track in the MP3 format",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QHZK8NRVL._SX300_.jpg,81.1,,Electronics,Portable Audio & Video,Portable CD Players,,,

Philips HDR612 TiVo 60 Hour Digital Video Recorder,"With up to 60 hours of program recording capacity, the Philips HDR612 offers the most hard disk space currently available in a personal video recorder.Unlike analog VCRs, Philips's HDR612 personal TV recorder uses TiVo technology to store compressed audio-video data to a computer hard disk. When you're ready to watch a preselected program, the HDR612 retrieves it upon command from a list of shows you've recorded. Among the most revolutionary aspects of the Philips/TiVo server is the ability to pause live broadcasts and either resume a program where you left off or return to real time. For example, while watching live sporting events, you can replay the last eight seconds of the action. You can then return to the live broadcast at any time. Using the palm-size remote, you can rewind and fast-forward pretaped programs and skip through recorded commercials if you choose.Philips supplies all the necessary cables for setting up the HDR612, including a 50-foot phone line and splitter. You don't need a separate phone line; simply connect the splitter to the wall, connect your phone and receiver cable to the splitter, and you're in business. The phone line is vital for downloading TV listings, recording shows, and receiving TiVo's Suggestions feature andTiVolution Magazine, which offer guidance and recommendations on the best programs to watch. After the initial download, the receiver spends about five minutes updating your programming data each night.The HDR612 has lots of great features that make it easier for this personal TV server to record programs as it learns your preferences. For example, the Suggestions feature actually offers input on shows you might enjoy based on your previous selections.TiVo's onscreen setup guide includes easy step-by-step instructions. TiVo charges $12.95 a month for weekly listings,TiVolution Magazine, and the Suggestions feature, or you can pay a one-time service charge of $299.Once you've selected a program to record, you have four choices of picture quality: basic, medium, high, or best. The higher settings take up more storage space, which translates into fewer hours of available record time.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/313NXFCHAQL._SX300_.jpg,134.5,,Electronics,Television & Video,Streaming Media Players,,,

Sony Portable 1-Piece AM/FM/CD Cassette Boombox (CFDGT50),"With its trendy cubist look, durable construction, and great sound, the  Sony CFDG50 CD/radio/cassette player is a pleasure to listen to. If you're  looking for a relatively inexpensive yet well-made and functional boombox with a  lot of bass kick, look no further.In our tests, this CD radio cassette recorder performed very well. The Digital  Bass Boost System does a great job of kicking the bass frequencies up a bit, and  it can be switched to remain active at all times. The speakers provide a full,  deep sound, performing well at high volumes.Sony's CFD-G50 is distinguished by a front-firing Power Drive Woofer. This  subwoofer, an uncommon feature in a boombox, is driven by a separate amplifier,  which bumps the unit's total output to 20 watts.  In our tests, we really heard  the ""boom"" in this boombox as the Power Drive Woofer provided a dynamic,  powerful sound when combined with the Mega Bass sound system. The overall sound  of this model is truly exceptional for a portable stereo system.The single-disc CD player offers a 20-track memory for programming.

Garmin eTrex Summit Waterproof Hiking GPS,"Amazon.com Product Description Palm-size, lightweight, and waterproof, Garmin's eTrex Summit is a 12-channel handheld global positioning satellite (GPS) receiver. The Summit's easy-to-use menu lets you create and view waypoints, save and view track logs, calibrate the compass and altimeter, access setup features, and more. Its trip and elevation computers calculate a range of data, including direction of movement; total and average ascent and descent; current, average and maximum speeds; trip odometer; and much more.Map page.View larger.Mark waypoint.View larger.The Garmin eTrex Summit is a simple, compact GPS device.View larger.Besides appreciating its small size, boaters and outdoorsmen will also be happy with the eTrex's unique button layout design. All the buttons are located on either side of the unit. The benefits of this design are two-fold. First, the eTrex is a breeze to operate with just one hand, and, second, with the buttons on both sides of the unit the bulk of the front of the device is dedicated to the large LCD display with backlight. The eTrex is so simple, it only sports five buttons--Page, Power, Up, Down, and Enter. Garmin also designed this tiny GPS to be completely waterproof so it can handle an accidental splash or dunk and continue to perform.Behind the waterproof protection, you'll find the proven performance of a 12-parallel-channel GPS receiver, which will run for up to 16 hours on just two AA batteries. The antenna is internal, and the external power and data connector are protected as well. In addition to determining your location, the eTrex creates, names, and saves a location as an electronic waypoint in its memory--with room for up to 500 individual waypoints. This allows you to navigate back to a point any time you want, from any location--or, with Garmin's TracBack feature, you can reverse your track log and navigate your way back home. And once you start moving, the GPS provides other data, like speed, direction of movement, time and distance to destination, and more.In addition to these basic features, the eTrex provides one more critical benefit: peace of mind. With GPS, you know where you are, where you've been, and where you are going. And since you always know your way back home, you can concentrate on enjoying yourself outdoors, on the water, or wherever your travels may take you.What's in the BoxeTrex Summit GPS receiver, wrist strap, user's guide, and quick-reference guide.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31T78YHJCQL._SY300_.jpg,149.9,,Electronics,GPS & Navigation,Sports & Handheld GPS,Handheld GPS Units,,

A favorite of audiophiles everywhere, the device is built to deliver powerful music, pure and simple, with few gratuitous extra controls to get in the way.

Sony SLV-N80 4-Head Hi-Fi VCR,"The Sony SLV-N80 4-head VCR is equipped to not only record and play VHS tapes, but also deliver enhanced video resolution due to its Reality Regenerator. The enhanced video exceeds most VHS recordings, and comes close to the quality of digital broadcasting regardless of the recording source. Sony added such additional features as digital tracking, which adjusts the tracking automatically to smooth playback; commercial skip, which advances the tape 30 seconds when selected; and hi-fi stereo recording and MTS stereo playback. People who currently own Sony Wega TVs or other Wega components will appreciate the VCR's silver chassis, which is designed to complement the Wega line.The VCR records in both SP and EP mode, while playing back in SP, EP, and LP modes. The slower EP mode is nearly as sharp as the SP mode due to the VCR's 19-micron heads, which reduce distortion and deliver a clear, digital-like picture.

JVC RX-1028VBK Dolby Digital/DTS Surround Receiver (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"JVC's RX-1028VBK offers a striking combination of features and performance. Included are a muscular 100 watts' output for all five channels (130 watts per channel for stereo), Dolby Digital and DTS surround decoding, a future-ready 5.1-channel input, S-video switching, 30&nbsp;FM and 15&nbsp;AM tuner presets, and enough connections--including a phono input--to keep even the most crazed home-theater enthusiasts happy for years.An especially endearing feature of the RX-1028VBK is that its remote control transmits via both IR (infrared) and RF (radio-frequency) signals. Most receivers get their signals via IR transmission. However, the RX-9000VBK also transmits and receives RF remote commands, so you can control the receiver from other rooms. Considering the fact that the RX-9000VBK also sports a dedicated ""sub-room"" stereo speaker output, this starts sounding pretty darn convenient.The RX-1028VBK's controls are intuitively arranged, and the two jog-shuttle controls are a godsend. One selects inputs, while the other governs multifunction settings for speaker balance, channel output levels, speaker crossover points (bass management), assigning source names, and customizing the Digital Signal Processor modes. Setup is further simplified by JVC's fine onscreen display menu, which lets you manage settings from your couch instead of from a crouch.Five audio/video inputs (four of which include S-video) and three audio-only inputs provide plenty of room to grow your system, and JVC wisely elected to use binding posts for all speaker terminals, a boon to those using (or planning to use) banana-terminated speaker cables for all channels. JVC's Text Compu Link shows CD track and title information (with CD&nbsp;Text-encoded discs) on both the receiver's dimmable fluorescent display and the onscreen display.The RX-1028VBK's four digital inputs correspond to DVD, CD, TV/DSB, and minidisc. You can also rename them to suit your needs.With stereo music the top-to-bottom balance is remarkable, thanks no doubt to the receiver's fully discrete amplifier outputs and JVC's legendary K-2 digital processing. High frequencies sound open, extended, and silky smooth. The bass has speed (dynamic precision) as well as impact. In the critical midrange area, vocals sound expressive with a good sense of body, while pianos, horns, and stringed instruments exhibit fine texture and presence.Things get even more exciting with Dolby Digital and DTS music and movies.

The camera uses a  2.4-megapixel Fuji Super CCD to capture images at an interpolated resolution of  2,400 x 1,600. Other possible resolutions include 1,280 x 960 and 640 x 480. The  FinePix 40i is also capable of recording AVI movies at a resolution of 320 x 240  at 10 frames per second, for up to 80 seconds.SmartMedia cards are used for storing both images and MP3 files, and the USB  port provides quick upload and download speeds for both images and audio. One  note: for copyright management reasons, all songs must be transferred to the  unit via the USB cable; a card recorded on a computer-based card reader or on a  friend's MP3 player can't be played on this unit.

Kodak DC4800 3.1MP Digital Camera w/ 3x Optical Zoom,"The DC4800 is Kodak's first 3-megapixel consumer digital camera. In terms of design, it's something of a departure from Kodak's earlier digital models and more of a return to the look and feel of a traditional film camera.  In its default setting, the camera is as easy to use as a point-and-shoot, but numerous manual controls are available for the more advanced user.Like most other 3-megapixel cameras, the Kodak features a 3x optical zoom lens plus a 2x digital zoom. Images are stored as JPEG or TIFF files on standard Type I CompactFlash cards, and the camera is powered by a rechargeable lithium-ion battery and AC adapter (included). USB output makes image transfers quick, and a video-out plug lets you view your images on your TV. The 4800 has several unusual features that help to set it apart from the rest of the 3-megapixel pack. For example, Kodak has included dedicated controls on the top of the camera to adjust the aperture and exposure compensation, rather than forcing users to wade through a sea of menus to access these frequently used settings.  In addition, the camera offers better-than-usual control of white balance and color saturation.The camera ships with a neck strap, lens cap, 16 MB CompactFlash card, lithium-ion rechargeable battery, AC adapter, USB cable, video cable, user's guide, and software CD.

Glenayre @ctiveLink Wireless Stand Alone Messaging Springboard Module,"With the Glenayre @ctiveLink Wireless Messaging Module, you can easily keep in constant contact via e-mail and stay up-to-date on the latest news, stock reports, and sports scores--all from your Handspring Visor.The @ctiveLink module connects to a ReFLEX wireless network and transfers data at an average of 9.6 KB per second. The ReFLEX wireless network provides the broadest coverage and best in-building penetration. No dialup or login is required, and you can leave the @ctiveLink connected to the network even when the module is removed from the Visor. It is powered by two AAA batteries and also includes a backup Ni-Cad battery that maintains module power and protects stored messages if the AAA batteries' power becomes too low.When the @ctiveLink module is inserted into the Visor's Springboard expansion slot, its three embedded applications automatically start up and are automatically downloaded into the handheld. The @ctiveLink application is the main window for your wireless services, showing network connection and available applications. It will also display pending messages and the unit's battery level.BeamLink is the two-way messaging application that enables you to compose, read, and send e-mail. You can attach items such as addresses, appointments, to-do notes, and memos to messages you send. If you send an attachment to someone else who uses BeamLink, they can save that attachment onto their Visor. If you send an attachment to a non-Palm OS user, contents are simply listed within the e-mail. Messages that are received are downloaded into the Visor when the module is inserted.InfoBeam provides a collection of Internet query applications that allow the device to request and receive information on demand from a variety of Internet sources--from stock quotes, sports, and news updates to weather reports and airline flight information. Other services include the ability to track FedEx and UPS packages and search phone directories (white and yellow pages). Note that you cannot view Web sites with InfoBeam. Also, information is automatically downloaded from the inserted @ctiveLink module to the Visor and deleted when the module is removed (@ctiveLink and BeamLink applications remain in the Visor's memory even when the module is removed).The @ctiveLink module can be used much like a pager--even when removed from the Visor, it will continue to receive and store messages as long as it is turned on and is in network range. A green LED on the front of the module shows that its power is on. If the green light blinks fast, new messages have been received. Messages that are received are downloaded into the Visor when it's inserted.Important note to customers: The Glenayre @ctiveLink Wireless Messaging Module requires a minimum $24.95 monthly wireless service option through Metrocall.

Fujifilm FinePix 1300 1.2MP Digital Camera,"Compare a scooter to a motorcycle. The scooter is a fraction of the size, power, and price, but around town, the scooter is as quick and fun as the motorcycle, and you can even take it some places the motorcycle won't go. The Fuji 1300 is the digital camera equivalent of a scooter--inexpensive and lower tech than some digital cameras, but really quick, easy, and fun to operate. And for the average camera user it will produce pictures very nearly as good as those from a substantially more expensive camera.The 1300 is a revised version of Fuji's well-loved but short-lived MX-1200 camera. For the 1300, Fuji redesigned the case to make it (slightly) more stylish and replaced the serial transfer plug with a much faster USB connection. Otherwise, the camera remains essentially the same as its predecessor.Compared to virtually every digital camera on the market (and especially its 1-megapixel peers), this camera is a speed demon. If you don't need to use the flash, you can turn the camera on and take your first shot in under a second. There's virtually no shutter lag (the shutter clicks a split second after you press the button), and the camera is ready to take another shot in less than 5 seconds. Though some cameras' LCD screens are slow, streaky, or choppy, the Fuji has a fast, smooth display.Technophobes have little to fear: this Fuji is as easy to operate as a point-and-shoot film camera, automatically setting shutter speed and white balance and activating the flash, if necessary. Users looking for more creative control can adjust the exposure compensation, white balance, flash, and other settings manually. The camera also has a macro mode and a self-timer.Pros:Very quick performanceUSB uncommon in cameras in this price rangeSimple and fun to operateCons:No video out (to display images on TV)Macro abilities limited by fixed-focus lens",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/410K6EFQ6NL._SX300_.jpg,134.5,,Electronics,Camera & Photo,Digital Cameras,Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,,

Autofocus, autoexposure, autoflash, and automatic film operation do all the rest.3.3x Zoom Lens with Innovative Compact DesignMinolta 's long-time expertise and years of research and development in compact optical designs have achieved a perfect embodiment of functionality and form:the Freedom Zoom 125.With dimensions of 4.41 x 2.36 x 1.73 inches and a weight of only 6.7 ounces,it can slip easily into a shirt pocket or purse to take anywhere.The Key to 125 CompactnessThe key to the Freedom Zoom 125 's winning combination of small size and high capabilities is Minolta technology.The Freedom Zoom 125 has been downsized to the absolute minimum by the use of a new compact zoom lens system with a low-profile three-cylinder lens barrel, plus efficient unit design and placement of components,as well as a geared film drive motor and a protective aluminum front shell. In addition,a new zoom design,two double-sided aspheric elements were incorporated,significantly reducing the number of the lens elements.Precision alignment of these elements has created a compact lens that also offers clear crisp images throughout the entire zoom range. Furthermore,the thin viewfinder optical system adopts a compact Dach prism inversion system for optimum clarity.The use of a thin,protective aluminum front shell,plus a geared motor in the film transport mechanism also play a significant role in the camera 's compactness.Long Range 3.3x Zoom LensFeaturing a full 3.3x zoom lens with a 37.5mm -125mm focal length, the Freedom Zoom 125 allows users to take advantage of virtually any photographic opportunity.The 37.5mm focal length is ideal for landscape shots and travel photos of family and friends in front of famous landmarks.A longer focal length captures candid snapshots and portraits,while the powerful 125 mm telephoto setting captures lively expressions of friends and families.At the 125mm focal length, users can get as close as 23.6 inches to small objects such as flowers and collectibles for close-up shots with a maximum magnification of 1/4.6.High Image QualityWith its state-of-the-art high performance lens optics and superior autofocus and autoexposure systems,the Freedom Zoom 125 delivers beautifully crisp,high contrast images at every focal length -from wide-angle to telephoto, landscape pictures to close-ups.Advanced SLR-type AutofocusingThe Freedom Zoom 125 features a passive AF system with up to 900 focusing steps to produce ultra-sharp results.This AF system is similar to that used on sophisticated Single-lens Reflex cameras (SLR 's)and is capable of precise focus even on distant subjects, mirror images,or subjects beyond a windowpane.In addition,multi-AF, with a wide focus sensor, ensures accuracy in difficult focusing situations such as flexible framing of off-center subjects, when two people are standing side by side, or when multiple subjects are detected at different distances.Reliable 3-Segment MeteringThe Freedom Zoom 125 's 3-segment metering system assures correct exposure under a variety of lighting conditions and throughout the entire zoom range even in difficult lighting situations.The 3-segment system consists of one large and one small AE sensor to determine exposure,and an AF sensor for back light detection only.The camera uses either the large or the small AE sensor depending on the zoom position.With this system,the brightness value in the center of the viewfinder (main subject area)is measured by the AF sensor and compared with the overall average brightness as measured by the AE sensor in use.If the background brightness greatly exceeds that of the subject area,the flash will fire in Autoflash or Autoflash w/red-eye reduction mode to provide the optimum subject exposure.Sleek,Casual DesignThe Freedom Zoom 125 can be easily distinguished from other compact zoom cameras by a design that emphasizes high quality materials,taste,functionality,and form.The high-quality body is covered with an aluminum front shell designed with gentle,streamlined curves.The buttons and other controls are conveniently located for comfort and ease of use by a wide range of hand sizes.Metallic pearl paint applied on the front exterior offers a fine,silky touch.The lens barrel surface is highlighted with a combination matte and high-luster finish,while the front plaque is stainless steel.Adding a casual touch to the body is metallic silver paint on the back and a contoured arch grip.Worry-Free Film Chamber LockThe Freedom Zoom 125 's Film Chamber Lock provides worry-free film handling from the moment the film is inserted into the camera until it is unloaded.After loading the film,the back cover remains securely locked until the film is rewound back into its cartridge.Featured in Minolta 's Advanced Photo System cameras,Film Chamber Lock is now available in the compact Freedom Zoom 125.Built-in FlashThe Freedom Zoom 125 's versatile built-in flash features autoflash, manual fill,night portrait,red-eye reduction,and flash-cancel modes.Red-Eye ReductionTo prevent red-eye,the built-in flash fires a short flash burst to close down the subject 's pupils before the exposure flash is fired and the picture is taken.The flash is also used as an AF illuminator to assist autofocusing in low light.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/419JNHW3FHL._SX300_.jpg,134.5,,Electronics,Camera & Photo,Film Photography,Film Cameras,Point & Shoot Film Cameras,

Panasonic PV-DV600 Digital Camcorder with 3&quot; LCD and Adobe Photo Deluxe Software,"Panasonic's PV-DV600 digital Palmcorder camcorder is a compact high-resolution camcorder that uses the Mini DV digital format. It's a perfect choice for home users who demand both high quality and flexibility. The 18x optical/300x digital zoom allows you to use seven zoom speeds to zoom in for close-ups or zoom out for wide-angle shots. The camera includes digital electronic stabilization technology in both record and playback modes to remove excessive movement from previously recorded images as well as while shooting.The PV-DV600 also works as a still camera, capturing 640 x 480 snapshots onto either Mini DV tape or an included 8 MB Panasonic MultiMediaCard (MMC). The MMC holds 60 images at 640 x 480 or 240 at 320 x 240. Though this is a handy feature, don't count on it to replace a dedicated digital or still camera. These 640 x 480 images are great for onscreen viewing (Web pages, e-mail attachments, etc), but the resolution is barely adequate for even 3-by-5 inch prints.The PV-DV600 offers several different digital effects in addition to zoom capabilities. The ""digital mirror"" creates a mirror-like symmetrical image, while ""strobe"" digitally freezes a series of images. ""Mosaic"" turns the image into a mosaic pattern, and ""slim"" expands the image vertically. The PV-DV600 can also stretch the image horizontally and form multiple impressions of images in motion and gradually fade them out for a ""trail"" effect. The PV-DV600 gives you the option of playing back your recording in either B&W;, sepia, or color.For best results in low-light situations, Panasonic has included a color-enhancement light. If you're looking for a stealthier way to shoot in low-light conditions, the camera's infrared capability allows you to record video in near total darkness in B&W;, blue, or green. The PV-DV600 has a 12-bit/16-bit PCM stereo with two sets of stereo audio tracks--this means you can add a second track of music or narration. This camcorder includes an 8 MB MultiMediaCard, PhotoVu Link (serial connection), and a FireWire interface (IEEE 1394).This camera is a step up from Panasonic's PV-DV400. In addition to the 400's features, the 600 includes a color-enhancement light, Adobe PhotoDeluxe software for digital stills, and analog-in plugs to allow you to transfer old VHS or 8mm movies to the DV format.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51D2R04QVJL._SY300_.jpg,134.5,,Electronics,Camera & Photo,Video,Camcorders,,

This means that you get crisp, in-focus shots  regardless of the lighting situation.

The 22-66mm lens is versatile enough to be used for almost every  kind of photography scene, from landscape to group shots to portraits, and even  detailed close-ups.With the easy-to-use APS film system, you no longer have  to worry if you've loaded the film correctly. You can also change the film  cartridge at any frame. This allows you the freedom to switch back and forth  between color and black-and-white film, or to keep your subject matter on  separate rolls.

Kodak DC3400 2MP Digital Camera with 2x Optical Zoom,"The Kodak DC3400 was created to take the place of the DC280, one of Amazon.com's top-selling digital cameras of all time. Essentially, Kodak faithfully kept all of what made the DC280 such a great camera--2.1-megapixel images, 2x optical zoom, ease-of-use--and placed it in a new body with a more traditional shape. The DC3400 has enjoyed some great reviews from publications, which cite Kodak's trademark color saturation, the easy-to-use menu system, and its resemblance to the popular DC280.The 2.1-megapixel CCD captures images at resolutions of 1,760 x 1,168 or 896 x 592 pixels. At both resolutions, Kodak offers three levels of JPEG compression to choose from. Files are saved to the included 8 MB CompactFlash card. The built-in flash features auto, off, fill, and red-eye reduction modes.Kodak was aiming for the middle of the consumer market with the DC3400. Essentially a point-and-shoot camera, the DC3400 features a degree of customization not normally found in point-and-shoots. Exposure compensation (EV) can be adjusted in increments of 0.5 EV, from +2 to -2 EV. The user can select center-weighted or multipattern metering. Center-weighted metering allows the photographer to adjust for a backlit subject and helps portraits come out well. Multipattern metering takes samples from the entire frame and averages the light values. Image sharpness can be adjusted to one of three presets: Sharp, Standard, and Soft. Also, white balance can be set to auto, daylight, fluorescent, or tungsten.The 2x zoom of the DC3400 is perhaps its weakest point, but even that can be overcome--if you don't mind the decrease in resolution required when you use the 3x digital zoom. All in all, the DC3400 is a good choice if you're looking for a point-and-shoot digital camera with good image quality, saturated color, and a certain level of customization.Pros:Easy-to-use point-and-shoot digital cameraAllows for a good amount of customizationKodak color saturationCons:2x optical zoom is a bit weak8 MB memory card will need to be upgraded quickly",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Z2EEFNQHL._SX300_.jpg,7.33,,Electronics,Camera & Photo,Digital Cameras,Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,,

Making sure you have guaranteed compatibility is very important because of the hundreds of different brands, types, and configurations of memory available. As a result, memory that works in one product doesn't necessarily work in another--and there's nothing more frustrating than buying something you can't use.Because compatibility is so critically important, Amazon has forged a strategic relationship with Viking Components and created the Memory Finder. TheMemory Finderis a tool that can help you find memory that works with your specific product, taking the guesswork out of buying memory.Benefits of Additional MemoryBelow are listed just a few of the many reasons to purchase additional memory:Increased Speed: Increasing your computer's memory will speed up access times and translates to faster processing speeds. For example, doubling the memory in your computer often results in 50 percent faster data processing.Increased Power: Increasing your computer's memory will enable it to process more data. You can have more windows and documents open at the same time. Computer game play becomes faster and more fluid, and high-end graphic programs perform more quickly.Increased Performance: Increasing your computer's memory can decrease the amount of times your computer crashes.

Konka KD1800U1 DVD Player,"The name is Konka, and judging from the KD-1800U1 DVD player, this Chinese company has done its homework.The KD-1800U1 is extremely well made. In fact, it weighs 10.5 pounds--roughly four pounds more than competing models. Although weight isn't necessarily a barometer of good build quality, if you're attracted to metal, you'll love this machine, which has a solid brushed-aluminum faceplate wrapped around a metal chassis lid.Although the KD-1800U1's silver finish is prone to reflecting light, Konka seems to understand that big, bright display lights are a distraction when you're watching a movie in a darkened room. Konka uses small, faint-blue LCDs to display disc information such as chapter, track, and elapsed time. An unobtrusive red DVD logo appears in the center of the display, while a tiny, green standby button resides in the left corner.Front-panel controls include Open/Close, Skip+ and Skip-, Play, Pause, and Stop, along with a Power button that rests flush when engaged. Unlike some front-panel buttons, which feel like they'll fall off if you jiggle them too much, Konka's controls are strong and reliable. The shiny, silver disc tray opens and closes smoothly, without hesitation.Glancing at the back panel, we were disappointed to learn that Konka has eliminated the optical digital-audio output on the KD-1800U1, the model that replaced the older KD-1800U. Fortunately, we prefer using coaxial digital cables--they're less expensive than fiber-optic cables and are less prone to disconnecting.Although the KD-1800U1 doesn't have component-video outputs, we had no qualms with this omission, given that most consumers who are searching for a bargain DVD player don't own TVs with component-video inputs. However, Konka did include an S-video output, which should please most home theater enthusiasts.Another omission is the lack of DTS-compatibility. Depending on your point of view, this is either a gross oversight or a wise decision. We think it's smart, given our experience with several sub-$200 DVD players that carry the Digital Theater Systems logo but are unable to satisfactorily pass the DTS signal onto an audio-video receiver. Kudos to Konka for playing it safe and recognizing that most consumers shopping in this price range will not fret at the absence of DTS compatibility.Konka's player performed flawlessly on all the Dolby Digital discs we played--from action flicks to high-drama to U2'sRattle and Hum5.1-channel concert DVD. Although the KD-1800U1 doesn't offer any video-enhancing circuitry, such as black-level expansion, we were satisfied with the player's ability to produce accurate images on our 54-inch rear-projection TV. Contrast levels, colors, and image depth were impressive during both daylight and nighttime viewing, with no digital artifacts or other anomalies that could be attributed to the player's video decoder.In 5.1-channel Dolby Digital, the KD-1800U1's audio D-to-A converters were equally impressive. On music CDs, the KD-1800U1 was able to reproduce the audio spectrum--from the highest highs to the lowest lows--better than most DVD players we've heard. Granted, Toshiba, and Sony DVD players still reign supreme when it comes to offering exceptional digital-to-analog audio converters, but the Konka KD-1800U1 is the best music machine we've auditioned in this price range.When it comes to ergonomics, Konka has also demonstrated it understands consumers. The remote control isn't fancy, but it is intuitive. The Select button and navigation arrows are located in the center of the remote, where they're easy to access with a thumb. Stop and Play buttons are located just above the Select button. A ""trap door"" slides open on the bottom of the remote to load the batteries. It also reveals a Setup button, which gives you quick access to the player's most important functions, such as choosing Dolby Digital 5.1 audio and selecting the screen's aspect ratios (standard 4:3, 16:9 widescreen, or 4:3 letterbox). Konka also included a Return button, so you can get out of the Setup menu with ease.The Power and Eject buttons are isolated at the top of the remote, where they're easy to find. Disc Skip, Fast-Forward, and Rewind buttons are clustered together near the upper-left corner of the remote. A Subtitle button enables you to glide through the options available on a given DVD, while an On/Off button makes it easy to get rid of the subtitles if you fail to deactivate them when you start the disc.The onscreen menus are distinguished by large letters that are very easy to read--just one of the many thoughtful features that make the KD-1800U1 a bargain.Other features include the ability to play CD-Rs; the ability to play DVDs encoded with up to eight audio tracks, including Chinese, of course; and the ability to display up to 32 subtitle languages--from Afar to Zulu. (The audio language and subtitle features depend on whether the disc itself offers these options.)For consumers who may have concerns about purchasing an electronics product made in China, rest assured the KD-1800U1 is well-built. One might also consider that 40 years ago, up-and-coming Japanese companies were greeted with great skepticism when they decided to compete with the Western giants that dominated consumer electronics. If the KD-1800U1 is any indication of the kinds of products we can expect from Konka--which has been manufacturing TVs since 1980--this rising star is about to change America's perception of the words ""Made in China.""--Eric GillProsExtremely impressive build qualityAttractive brushed aluminum designRemote control is simple to useGood sound and image qualityConsNo headphone jackNo backlight on the remote",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31YP0KCZJ8L._SX300_.jpg,134.5,,Electronics,Television & Video,DVD Players & Recorders,DVD Players,,

Sony DCRTRV120 Digital Camcorder,"The Sony DCR-TRV120 uses the Digital 8 format, which digitally records  images onto standard Hi8 tapes. If you're upgrading from an 8mm or Hi8 camera,  this format gives you the combined benefits of digital image quality and  backwards compatibility with your old tapes.A 25x optical zoom and 450x  digital zoom will bring your shots closer, and Sony SteadyShot image  stabilization technology will help to keep shakes and wobbles out of your video.  For audio, the DCR-TRV120 offers 16-bit PCM digital stereo with 12-bit dubbing.  If you prefer to shoot in the 16:9 widescreen ratio, this is also an option. To  compose your films, you can use either the standard eyepiece viewfinder or a  2.5-inch swivel color LCD display.With Sony's LaserLink feature, playback can  be a snap--you just aim the DCR-TRV120 at the LaserLink receiver on select Sony  TVs from up to 16 feet away, press play, and enjoy your videos directly on your  TV--without wires or cassette adapters.If you're planning to digitally edit  your videos on your computer, the Sony includes an industry standard IEEE 1394  port (also known as iLink and FireWire) for image transfer, and a Control-L  (LANC) interface for connection to editing equipment.Sony's Super NightShot  infrared system lets you capture footage in two modes. In standard NightShot  mode the camera uses available visible and infrared light to illuminate the  subject. With Super NightShot, an infrared LED on the front of the camera acts  like an infrared spotlight: to the naked eye, it just looks like a standard red  LED, but it produces enough infrared light to effectively illuminate the area in  front of the camera.The camera includes numerous extra features, including 14  picture effects and a five-mode audio-video fader, end search (which  automatically forwards your tape to the end of the last footage shot), edit  search, seven-mode program auto exposure, pass-through analog AV inputs, and an  intelligent shoe for accessories.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4196JXSXJNL._SX300_.jpg,9.91,,Electronics,Camera & Photo,Video,Camcorders,,

Polaroid i-zone 0.3MP Digital and Instant Combo Camera,"The Polaroid i-zone digital and instant Combo Camera splices together the popular i-zone instant camera with a basic digital camera. You can take an i-zone postage-stamp size picture, and then turn the camera over and take the same picture with the digital camera at a resolution of 640 x 480. This device is essentially two separate cameras that share one set of batteries. The digital camera has 1 MB of built-in memory and can store up to 18 images. Both the i-zone and digital camera use fixed-focus lenses, so you never need to worry about taking out-of-focus pictures. A serial cable is included to download your images to your PC. Software is included to spruce up and modify your digital images. Included in the box are a serial image transfer cable, batteries, sticky film, and assorted software.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41WK4M5FGYL._SX300_.jpg,43.88,Polaroid,Electronics,Camera & Photo,Digital Cameras,Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,,
Sony DCMM1 Digital Camcorder with Builtin Digital Still Mode,"Sony's DCM-M1 digital camcorder is unique in several ways: for starters, it uses discs instead of tapes as its recording medium. Sony calls these proprietary discs MiniDisc Data2 Media or MD View Discs. Though they're the same size as traditional minidiscs (approximately 3 inches), the new format holds 650 MB of memory--the same as a standard CD. At the highest image quality, each disc holds 10 minutes of footage.To maximize recording time, Sony records the audio and video to the disc with a pair of advanced compression algorithms. For video, the camera records in MPEG-2 (the same format used on DVD discs), and ATRAC (the algorithm used for MiniDisc audio units) is used to capture sound. Sony refers to this audio-video combination as the Video MD format.In another departure from digital video standards, there's no IEEE 1394 (FireWire) interface to allow you to transfer your footage to your computer. Instead, the camera's AC adapter has a built-in Ethernet connection, which effectively lets your camera function as a computer on your network. To transfer images to and from the camera, you use a Web browser (both Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator work). Stills are imported to your computer as JPEG files and movies appear in QuickTime format. In addition, traditional analog audio- and video-out plugs let you view your films on a TV or record them on a VCR.With the DCM-M1, there's no need for video editing software or hardware--extensive video editing can be done within the camera itself. In edit mode, you can move, copy, trim, erase, divide, or group any video scenes. Because the DCM-M1 is based on a random-access (nonlinear) recording format, you can jump to scenes without rewinding or forwarding, and rearranging scenes is a snap.The camera can also record stills--up to 4,500 images at 640 x 480 resolution fit on a single MD View Disc. It can also record up to 260 minutes of audio in the ATRAC format, as well as play recorded or prerecorded audio MiniDiscs.Like most digital camcorders, the camera features both a traditional eyepiece viewfinder and a 3.5-inch swivel-mounted color LCD monitor. In an unusual twist, the LCD is touch-sensitive, serving as a simple and intuitive interface for video editing, and also allowing users to add hand-drawn annotations to films and stills.The optics and special effects are similar to those of other Sony digital camcorders. One notable feature: to steady images, Sony has included optical image stabilization, which uses sensors to monitor camera motion and then minutely moves the optics to compensate. Unlike the less-expensive digital image stabilization found on many other camcorders, optical image stabilization does not degrade the quality of the recording. The lens features a 10x optical and 40x total zoom, numerous special effects (black-and-white and sepia, for example), plus many different types of fades and wipes. Power is provided by a Sony InfoLithium battery (included). Also included with the camcorder are a charger, AC cable, AV cable, and a blank MD View Disc.This camera has so many unique features that it has no real competition. If you're looking for a camcorder that will give you extended recording time on a single tape, or if you're planning to edit your images extensively on a FireWire-equipped computer, then you're better off with a traditional Mini DV camcorder. If, on the other hand, you want a camcorder that allows extensive in-camera editing, and you plan to create brief (10 minutes or less) videos that you can easily share with your friends--or you just love really neat gadgets--this may be the perfect camcorder for you.Pros:Images are recorded on random-access discs instead of linear tapesTouchscreen and built-in effects allow extensive in-camera editingEthernet port provides a nearly universal method for transferring imagesCons:Each disc holds only 10 minutes of video at highest quality, and good luck finding a blank disc when you're on vacationNo FireWire port or frame-by-frame image transfer",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51S2zziNg2L._SX300_.jpg,134.5,,Electronics,Camera & Photo,Video,Camcorders,,

Fujifilm FinePix 4900 4.3MP Digital Camera w/ 6x Optical Zoom,"Fuji's FinePix 4900 is one of a new style of consumer digital cameras appearing on the market. Borrowing features from both film SLRs and point-and-shoot digital cameras, these hybrids offer an extremely potent set of features in a compact package and will undoubtedly steer even more film photographers over to digital.The 4900 features an impressive 6x optical zoom lens plus a 3.7x digital zoom. Shots are captured on a SuperCCD sensor that generates images at resolutions of up to 2,400 x 1,800 pixels, producing photo-quality prints at sizes of 8 by 10 and beyond. By default, the camera is as easy to operate as a point-and-shoot, but virtually every function is manually controllable. Shutter-priority and aperture-priority modes are available, and the ISO, focus, white balance, and exposure compensation can all be adjusted. A pop-up flash features slow-sync, fill flash, and red-eye reduction, and a hot shoe on top of the camera allows you to use a dedicated flash unit.Fuji has replaced the traditional optical viewfinder with a camcorder-style electronic viewfinder (EVF)--a tiny LCD display inside the eyepiece. The benefits of this arrangement are obvious: the EVF provides a traditional SLR-style through-the-lens viewing experience, works well even in bright sunlight, lets you hold the camera in the more stable, traditional position, and helps to extend battery life. However, there are some situations in which the EVF is inferior to a traditional optical viewfinder: if you're shooting in near darkness, it's virtually impossible to see through the viewfinder, and even in brighter light, the images tend to look grainy and washed out compared to the images in the 2-inch LCD on the back of the camera.The 2.4-megapixel SuperCCD sensor was developed by Fuji and is only found on Fuji cameras. Instead of using a traditional grid of square pixels, it features octagonal pixels arrayed diagonally. Fuji claims that this system offers improved sensitivity and image detail over a standard CCD. To prove this point, the camera interpolates its 2.4-megapixel images up to 4.3 megapixels at the highest-quality setting. Independent tests typically place these interpolated images on a par with pictures from a 3.3 megapixel camera.The 4900 is comfortable to hold, and its controls are logically arranged. Though it's bigger and heavier than a point-and-shoot, it's still smaller and lighter than an SLR, and the design feels good in your hands. The battery compartment forms a comfortable pistol grip for your right hand, and your left hand will naturally want to cradle the barrel. Fuji thoughtfully included dual zoom controls--one under your right thumb on the back of the camera, and the other under your left thumb on the barrel of the lens. An easy-to-reach thumb dial on the top of the camera controls shutter speed or aperture, depending upon your shooting mode, and a ring on the front of the lens manually adjusts focus.Files can be saved at numerous resolutions and levels of compression, from a massive uncompressed 2,400 x 1,800 TIFF file (one shot nearly fills the included 16 MB SmartMedia card) to basic 640 x 480 JPEG files appropriate for emailing. The camera also features a movie mode for creating low-resolution silent film clips.If you're an amateur photographer who loves using single-lens-reflex cameras but don't want to spend several thousand dollars on a true digital SLR, Fuji's FinePix 4900 offers most of the functionality of a digital SLR at a fraction of the price. The lens is not removable, but its 35-210mm range (35mm equivalent) is flexible enough to use in nearly any situation.Pros:Impressive 6x zoom lensComfortable, well-arranged controlsEasy to use for beginners and experienced photographersCons:Electronic viewfinder is hard to use in some conditions",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ME06E3MRL._SX300_.jpg,12.49,,Electronics,Camera & Photo,Digital Cameras,Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,,

With the growing popularity of DVD, DSS, and Digital TV, clear, sharp pictures with bright, vivid, natural-looking colors are finding their way into living rooms everywhere. High quality video interface is critical for thebest system performance. Ordinary wire's flimsy construction, poor dielectrics and interior shielding cause signal degradation and provide little protection against outside electromagnetic (EM) and radio frequency (RF) interference.Monster Video 3 Offers Reference Video Cable PerformanceMonster Video 3's (MV3) reputation for delivering the clearest, sharpest picture and the brightest, most accurate colors is well-founded. MV3 was the first video cable ever to receive certification by the prestigious Imaging Science Foundation &#x96; the home theatre industry's recognized authority on video reproduction. With an extremely linear bandwidth to 550MHz and 75-Ohm impedance, MV3 offers consistently outstanding picture definition for composite video, component video and cable TV. MV3 features a unique gas-injected dielectric for improved, high velocity signal transfer. true metal-to-metal double shielding of foil and copper braid provides maximum protection against EM and RF interference.Gas-Injection: The Fuel for Signal TransferMV3's signal-carrying conductor is embedded in the center of a unique dielectric (insulator). Gas is injected into the dielectric, creating uniform, microscopic cells that allow the conductor to rest in the exact center of the cable (even when the cable is bent). The result is consistent 75-Ohm impedance for maximum signal strength, consistent performance and efficient transfer to video signals between components.Certifiably the BestThe Imaging Science Foundation demands stringent standards be met for cable certification. MV3 not only meets ISF standards but exceeds them. That's why ISF calls Monster Video 3 ""absolutely necessary for good pictures in home theatre.""

However, simply connecting an extra speaker to an amplifier is not the solution, as its speakers added to an amp the resistance (also known as impedance) is lowered and amplifiers have a limit as to how low of a resistance they can handle. Extra speakers cause the impedance (ohms) to drop, stressing the amp beyond its limits. When this situation exists damage to the circuitry, amp shutdown, and even the risk of the amp burning up and catching fire can occur. This is a high price to play for music enjoyment., however, the impedance (ohms) may drop stressing the amp beyond its limits. When this situation exists damage to the circuitry, amp shutdown, and even the risk of teh amp burning up and catching fire can occur. This is a high price to pay for music enjoyment.Using a speaker selector can avoid damaging your amp, however ordinary speaker selectors use resistors in series which limit the high frequencies so you hear less detail in the music.

Yamaha YST-SW45 8&quot; Subwoofer,"Add bass to your music and spice to your life with Yamaha's YST-SW45 active subwoofer, a compact and affordable way to increase your enjoyment of music, movies, and even computer audio.With a 70-watt built-in amplifier, line-level inputs, high-quality five-way binding-post speaker inputs and outputs, plus an auto-on standby circuit, volume level, and adjustable crossover (see FAQ for more info), the YST-SW45 is about as flexible as they come. Setup was a snap--we were able to dial in just the right amount of bass and the correct crossover point within minutes. And its manageable size makes the YST-SW45 easy to place; you can tuck it into a corner, next to a sofa, or even under a desk.Besides being flexible, the YST-SW45 is also a fine performer, thanks to Yamaha's long-throw 8-inch woofer and active-servo technology, which tracks the movement of the driver and matches it to the incoming signal, correcting any perceived errors (or distortion). In addition, the front-firing bass port effectively increases the speaker's sensitivity and bass output, delivering very good definition with a decent punch and a good sense of low-end body.But we must take issue with Yamaha's frequency-response rating, which is inflated because the stated 30 to 200 Hz performance is measured at -10 dB, rather than the standard -3 dB. In other words, at 30 Hz (or cycles per second)--very deep bass indeed--the YST-SW45 does have measurable output, but it's 10 decibels below its average output at, say, 60 Hz. Our test tones indicate that the YST-SW45's -3 dB point is around 42 Hz, which is still quite good, but not subterranean.Compact, flexible, and well made, with a more-than-respectable if not explosive bass output, Yamaha's YST-SW45 is a fine, small active subwoofer. Unless you have a huge room or love bass to rattle your cage, it will nicely fill out the sound of any compact speaker or home theater rig.--Wayne GarciaPros:Compact and versatile5-way binding-post speaker terminals2-year warrantyCons:Bass not as deep or powerful as Yamaha's ratings suggest",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31AJ9PE33EL._SY300_.jpg,99.95,,Electronics,Home Audio,Stereo Components,Speakers,Subwoofers,

Hewlett Packard PhotoSmart C618 2MP Digital Camera w/ 3x Optical Zoom,"Despite the fact that Hewlett-Packard has produced a number of successful digital cameras in the past and is one of the biggest manufacturers of photo-quality printers, the company's lack of experience in film cameras has made it difficult for the public to take them seriously in this field. To help change this perception, Hewlett-Packard has paired up with Pentax for its latest product, and each company has contributed its expertise. The result is a pair of identical cameras: the HP 618 and the Pentax EI 200. With the exception of labels, packaging, and included accessories, the two cameras are the same.The camera's basic specifications are pretty standard: 2-megapixel CCD, 3x Pentax optical zoom, CompactFlash storage (Type I or II, but no Microdrive support), and a 2-inch display. For advanced users, there are aperture and shutter priority modes, adjustable white balance, exposure metering, and adjustable ISO (100 and 200).If you like the look and feel of Pentax cameras, you'll appreciate the HP's styling. It's curvy, swoopy, classically designed, and feels very solid. Most people who saw the camera were impressed with its overall quality and were surprised to learn it was a digital.One of the camera's most intriguing (and underdocumented) features is its use of Digita. Digita is an operating system created specifically for digital cameras, allowing software developers to modify and improve the camera's functions. Past Digita cameras have suffered from slow performance, but the 618 seems as quick as most other digital cameras on the market. HP's engineers did a great job of shipping the camera with a wide variety of menus and functions preinstalled, but Digita allows for even more flexibility. Potential applications of this technology range from task-specific features (time-lapse photography, preset exposure modes, and digital special effects, for example) as well as the ability to add new applications--there are even Digita video games available for download. Unfortunately, the manual includes no information about Digita, and we were unable to determine how to transfer Digita files to the camera.

NEC AccuSync 95F Flat Screen 19&quot; CRT Monitor,"The AccuSync 95F is a flat screen CRT (cathode ray tube) that combines high quality images with a very reasonable price tag. This 19-inch monitor (18 inches viewable) combines a 1,600 x 1,200 maximum resolution with a flicker-free 76 Hz refresh rate and a low 0.25mm dot pitch for accurate, clear images, ideal for a wide range of home and small business applications.A multilayered, dark-tint, antistatic screen coating helps to reduce glare and to deliver a sharp, crisp picture, while the refresh rate increases as the resolution decreases--down to 160 Hz for 640 x 480 resolution, further helping to reduce glare and the resulting eyestrain. Horizontal frequency ranges from 31 to 96 kHz, while an invar shadow mask resists expansion, even on high brightness settings.The easily adjustable menu-driven controls include brightness, contrast, horizontal/vertical position, moir&#xE9;, degauss, and more. The Intelligent Power Manager (IPM) complies with both EPA Energy Star and NUTEK standards.

Yamaha RP-U100 CAVIT External Audio Soundboard (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"Yamaha's RP-U100 brings sonic purity and ergonomic convenience to the unwieldy realm of computer audio. Desktop-friendly with its vertical posture and large volume knob, the audio receiver/processor is nothing short of a joy to use. In our experience, the benefits of easy access to input selection, audio processing, and a headphone jack are secondary to the simple fact of the unit's strong (30 watts per channel) amplifier power and high-end digital processing via Yamaha's YSS-918 ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit). The RP-U100 makes just about all music sound terrific--from CDs and high-bitrate MP3s to low-fi Real Audio snippets.The two-channel receiver connects to your computer through either traditional analog-audio jacks (left/right RCA on the inputs) or through a direct digital USB 1.1 connection (USB cable included). We recommend the USB connection, which gives you not only direct-digital signal routing for your MP3, WMA, games, and other audio, but access to a convenient graphical user interface and a staggering 208 station presets for the unit's built-in FM/AM tuner. (You can also access a perfectly adequate 40 presets from the front panel itself.)You'll need to supply your own speakers+ADs- we recommend bookshelf units with wide frequency response and high sensitivity--though with 30 watts per channel at your disposal, the RP-U100 won't be picky about speakers. The system offers auxiliary outputs, so you can hook it up with a powered 2.1 (stereo speakers and a subwoofer) computer-audio system, but that's not your only option when it comes to deep bass--the unit also sports a dedicated subwoofer output for use with a proper home-theater-type sub.One of the coolest things about the RP-U100 is that it digitizes analog sources, letting you feed it, say, an input from a cassette deck, and capture the sound as digital files through either the USB connection or through the system's optical digital-audio output. You can also make digital files from radio broadcasts. For tone controls, the system offers a powerful nine-band digital equalizer through the GUI (12 steps, 6 dB) but no bass or treble knobs on the hardware itself.A key strength is the unit's array of simulated surround algorithms, which broaden the perceived space in which you're listening--often through sophisticated acoustical sampling (as with Yamaha's own DSP, modeled after concert halls, cathedrals, and jazz clubs). We weren't uniformly impressed with the results--music almost never sounded better with DSP engaged, but games and certain DVDs proved more engaging with careful surround application. Six different DSP modes offer user-adjustable parameters for effect, initial delay, and room size.The RP-U100 is compatible with Window 98, 98SE, ME, 2000, and XP, and Macintosh OS 9.1 or higher, but computer control is optional. If you're an audio buff needing a compact and flexible integrated amplifier, you'll enjoy the RP-U100 with or without the USB connection and the GUI.--Michael MikesellPros:Intuitive setupStrong amplifierLarge, firm volume control with smooth level incrementsHigh-quality headphone jackAnalog to digital bridging for loading material onto your computerCons:No front-panel tone controlsNo phono inputStatic shock will sometimes disable the speakersWhat's in the BoxReceiver, software CD-ROM, USB cable, FM and AM antennas, and a user's manual.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/313908ZTB5L._SY300_.jpg,134.5,,Electronics,Computers & Accessories,Computer Components,Internal Sound Cards,,

Toshiba 61H70 61-Inch HDTV-Ready Projection TV,"The Toshiba 61H70 is a 61-inch projection television that comes with all the trimmings. A picture tube--or cathode ray tube (CRT)--has an electron gun that presents an image by sending the electron beam to the tube's faceplate. The Toshiba 61H70 has three such tubes, in red, green, and blue. They use fine phosphor for high resolution, brightness, and color purity.For fine tuning, use the remote control to adjust nine points on the screen. The result is very good focus and superior picture quality.With A/V outputs you can send the audio/video signal to a VCR for recording. The fixed audio outputs can also be sent to an A/V receiver, and provide a cleaner signal than variable audio outputs. An extra set of front A/V inputs allows you to connect a camcorder or other portable device.The Toshiba 61H70 has ColorStream HD component video inputs, the best inputs to use for today's high-resolution digital sources, such as a DVD player or an HDTV set-top box.The universal remote has been programmed to operate the TV, most VCRs, and cable boxes. Many of the keys are illuminated for easy access when watching TV in a dark room. The remote accesses all TV functions with an icon-based on-screen display. This full-featured system can be operated in English, French, or Spanish. In addition, the remote learns the codes of other remotes.You can input your 12 favorite channels and easily scan through only those stations. Pressing the return button sends you to the last channel you were viewing. This allows you to easily switch back and forth between two channels. You can label your channels by putting the call letters (e.g. ABC, HBO) on the screen along with the station numbers.At the touch of a button, a sleep timer allows you to fall asleep and program the TV to turn off in 15-minute intervals for up to three hours.Any time you press the mute button, closed captioning automatically engages. So, if one viewer needs to answer the telephone, another can still read along.Now you can watch two channels at once, or find out what's on all your favorite channels. Two built-in tuners allow picture-in-picture without the use of a VCR. In single box mode, you can change the size of the sub-picture, move it to different locations on the screen, or freeze it. Six- and nine-box modes allow continuous channel previewing in multiple sub-pictures along the bottom of the screen. You can also use picture-outside-picture, whereby half the screen is used for the main image, while the other half is used for nine sub-pictures.The new V-chip lets parents decide which show ratings are appropriate for their children. The TV will block out the audio and video of any program with an inappropriate rating. Parents use a code to override the system.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RVN4W21PL._SY300_.jpg,134.5,,Electronics,Television & Video,Projection Screens,,,
Toshiba SD-1600 DVD Player,"Toshiba's SD-1600 further refines the stellar model for DVD quality  pioneered with the company's popular SD-3109 and SD-1200. Among the SD-1600's  standout features are composite-video, S-Video, and ColorStream component-video  outputs; Dolby Digital and DTS 5.1-channel digital outputs; 10-bit, 27 MHz video  digital-to-analog converters; and high-resolution (24 bits, 96 kHz) digital-audio converters.ColorStream component-video connectors, located on most Toshiba DVD-video  players and TVs, send an extremely high-quality signal from the DVD player to  the TV. Typical NTSC artifacts--like video noise and dot crawl--are virtually  eliminated in this connection method, resulting in a low-noise, high-detail  picture with astounding color purity.For video purists, the SD-1600 also offers PLUGE, a feature granting the player  the ability to pass below-black (or blacker-than-black) signals, which in turn  lets you accurately set black levels on your monitor--critical in a home  theater. This player is also DVD and CD Text compatible, so if you're using a DVD Text- or CD Text-encoded disc, the player will display disc and song titles for your convenience.A convenient feature called parallel video output lets you connect your Toshiba  DVD player via composite-, component-, and/or S-Video outputs and watch  simultaneous images from each connected TV or monitor. This is ideal for  multiroom applications.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31CWYT822FL._SX300_.jpg,33,,Electronics,Television & Video,DVD Players & Recorders,DVD Players,,

Toshiba SD-2150 Dual Tray DVD Player,"The Toshiba SD-2150 DVD player features ColorStream component-video  output, which allows the video signal to be transferred and processed in  separate elements.  The result is the highest level of picture quality with  remarkable detail and enhanced resolution. The TV you currently own may not have  component-video inputs, but your next one probably will, and this player will  allow you to take full advantage of this capability (most of Toshiba's current  TVs include component inputs).  S-video and composite video outputs provide more  connection flexibility, and parallel video outputs allow for the transfer of the  video signal to two different monitors simultaneously--ideal for multiroom  locations.Video Black Level Expansion with Pluge is an important image-enhancing feature.   This enhances contrast and deepens blacks, providing more vibrant colors while  helping set proper brightness levels. Other important video features include  10-bit, 27 MHz digital-to-audio conversion with a high-resolution filter that  provides rapid processing of the digital video, double-speed playback with  audio, and multiple-viewing-angle capability (when used with appropriately  encoded DVDs). Also included are a bit-rate meter, and A-B repeat to allow you  to program a certain segment for repeat playback.The SD-2150 also offers Spatializer virtual surround sound, an effect that  creates a simulated surround sound from a Dolby 5.1 channel or two-channel Dolby  Digital soundtrack.  A 24-bit D/A converter provides a rich sound and clean  audio texture.  Dolby and DTS coaxial digital outputs, along with a stereo audio  output, provide superior connectivity options for home theater audio.For convenience, Toshiba has included a dual-disc, twin-tray system with direct-disc  access.  You can insert or take out one disc while another is playing, and  have them play back-to-back for uninterrupted programming.  It's VCD/CD/DVD  playback capable, includes an onscreen menu display for easy picture and sound  adjustment, and comes with a full-function remote control.   Toshiba offers a 90-day warranty on labor and a one-year warranty on parts.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31QD3KW9A2L._SX300_.jpg,134.5,,Electronics,Television & Video,DVD Players & Recorders,DVD Players,,

Toshiba 36A60 36&quot; TV,"The Toshiba 36A60 is a high-quality 36-inch stereo TV with surround sound capabilities. Key picture features include a high-contrast FST black picture tube that reduces reflected light, increases contrast, and delivers a wider viewing area than do conventional direct view tube designs. A 3-line digital comb filter with vertical contour correction eliminates video noise such as dot crawl and color blooming by processing three consecutive lines of video information. The black level expander provides an increased black level for richer blacks and greater contrast. The convenient color temperature control allows the user to set the preferred white balance,  from cool blue to warm red, for viewing in any level or type of room light. Another effective feature is the invar shadow mask, a  nickel-iron alloy mask that reduces thermal expansion, preventing picture distortion and discoloration found when using conventional iron masks.Along with the great picture quality, viewers will also enjoy the sound performance features of the 36A60.  With surround sound capability, this TV provides an expanded sound from sources not encoded with other surround information. Two sets of stereo audio inputs on the rear panel, and one set on the front, along with ColorStream component-video inputs and an S-video input, give this TV the ability to receive the best picture and sound possible from your VCR and DVD players.Popular convenience features include channel labeling (alphanumeric labels that accompany channel numbers make identification of favorite channels quick and easy, such as designating channel 7 as ABC), closed captioning on mute (when available, closed captions appear automatically when television sound is muted, allowing the viewer to hear a phone call while still keeping up with dialog on the screen, and favorite channel (up to nine channels can be selected and held in a separate memory that can be quickly scanned).In addition, each input can be renamed onscreen. Video 1 can be renamed VCR, Video 2, DVD, for a few examples, making input selection quicker and easier for everyone in the house. Parents will appreciate the video lock feature, where access to the video inputs and Channels 3 and 4 can be denied. This feature can easily limit access to unsuitable programming or items such as video games or a VCR.To make controlling the 36A60 easy, it comes with a glow universal remote control. The brighter keys on this remote glow in the dark to make operation easier in a darkened room. And an icon-based onscreen display further simplifies television operation.The Toshiba 36A60 television comes with a warranty of two years on the picture tube, one year on all other parts, and one year on labor.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XMDE73AML._SX300_.jpg,134.5,,Electronics,Television & Video,TV-DVD Combinations,,,

Kodak DC3200 1MP Digital Camera,"In 1900, Kodak introduced the Brownie camera--a basic, simple design that cost $1. Its ease of use and low cost popularized amateur photography virtually overnight. Now, 100 years later, Kodak is hoping their DC3200 will play the same role and bring digital photography to the masses.It's as though Kodak asked us, ""What's the minimum set of features you feel are necessary in an entry-level digital camera?"" and built the DC3200 around these specifications. There's a traditional optical viewfinder (great if you want to save batteries or you like to compose photos the old-fashioned way), an LCD screen (for previewing and reviewing photos to ensure you're getting exactly the shot you want), 1 megapixel of image resolution (enough detail to produce sharp 4-by-6-inch prints), video-out mode (for viewing your pictures on a TV), a flash, plus expandable memory (via a CompactFlash slot). You can find digital cameras that cost less, but they're almost certainly lacking at least one of these key features.Where did Kodak cut corners to keep costs low? The lens is quite basic: it's fixed-focus instead of autofocus, and there's no zoom or macro--or even a lens cap. To transfer images to your computer, you use an older (and slower) serial cable instead of an increasingly common and much quicker USB cable. Finally, the 2 MB of memory that comes with the camera is internal and not on a removable card, so you can't use a separate card reader to transfer your photos. And last, you're forced to use Kodak's image-transfer software (compatible with Windows 95, 98, and 2000, but not Mac version) to put the photos on your computer.Camera operation is extremely easy. To take a picture, you just turn the camera on and press the shutter release--true point-and-shoot simplicity. Transferring images to your computer is nearly as easy: install the included software, connect the cable between your computer and your camera, set the camera to ""PC Connect"" mode, and start the software. A thumbnail index of the pictures on your camera should automatically appear on your computer's screen. A few mouse clicks later, the pictures are stored safely on your computer's hard drive. Picture quality is on a par with other 1-megapixel fixed-focus cameras--great for e-mailed photos and sharp enough for 4-by-6 prints that look like they're from a film point-and-shoot. Though there's no macro feature, everything from two feet to infinity is in focus.It's clear that Kodak is trying to make this camera as easy to use as possible. An included double-sided ""Quick Set Up"" sheet contains all of the information that most people will need to start using the camera, and both the hardware and software are designed to be simple. Compared to most digital cameras, this one is pretty easy to use, but if you're afraid to install software or crawl around to the back of your computer to connect the serial cable, you might want to invite a technically savvy friend or relative over to help you with the initial setup. For example, we had to install the software twice to get it to work properly, and if the transfer cable wasn't inserted all the way into the camera (it felt like it was plugged in firmly even when it wasn't), we had problems. These aren't major issues, but they can be frustrating, especially for beginners.If you're curious about digital photography but don't want to spend a fortune on a deluxe model, the Kodak DC3200 is a good choice. Though it doesn't have many bells and whistles, the camera is easy to use and captures images with enough detail for both e-mailed pictures and prints.Pros:Extremely simple operation.Good image quality for the priceBuilt-in flash, LCD, and video-out port not often seen on cameras in this price rangeCons:No self-timerIncluded memory is built-in instead of removable (though removable memory can be used)Not compatible with newer USB port; uses older (and slower) serial portCamera includes video-out connection, but cable is not included.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Q2C3HZSYL._SX300_.jpg,119.99,,Electronics,Camera & Photo,Digital Cameras,Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,,

Samsung Digimax 35 0.3MP Digital Camera/MP3,"Samsung has combined three of today's most popular electronic gadgets--digital cameras, MP3 players, and Webcams--into one compact device: the Digimax 35 MP3 digital camera. A true point-and-shoot camera, the Digimax uses a fixed-focus lens to provide simple operation, letting you worry about finding the perfect shot instead of finding the right camera settings. The 640 x 480 resolution of the Digimax makes great pictures to post on a Web site or send via e-mail.The Digimax 35 MP3 really shines when used in conjunction with its included accessories. The software that comes with the camera helps you to create panoramic shots, as well as animations and simulated 3-D images, and a small tripod makes it easy to use the camera as a Webcam.As mentioned above, two features set the Digimax 35 MP3 apart from other point-and-shoot digital cameras: an integrated MP3 player, and the ability to act as a Webcam. In MP3 mode, the camera plays files stored on CompactFlash cards. The camera's included 8 MB card will hold only about eight minutes of music--a couple of songs--so if you plan to use this feature, you'll want to invest in a larger-capacity memory card. As a Webcam, the camera can shoot footage at 5 frames per second (fps) at a resolution of 320 x 240, or 15 fps at a resolution of 160 x 120. A USB connection ensures speedy music and image transfers.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41YFCHCZPAL._SX300_.jpg,134.5,,Electronics,Camera & Photo,Digital Cameras,Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,,
Nikon Coolpix 880 3.2MP Digital Camera w/ 2.5x Optical Zoom,"With the Coolpix 880, Nikon has taken the 3.3-megapixel CCD and many of  the advanced features from its semiprofessional 990 model and put them into a  traditional compact point-and-shoot design simple enough for anyone to  use.The Nikkor all-glass lens features a 2.5x optical zoom (equivalent to 38- 95mm on a 35mm camera) with a macro mode that focuses down to 1.6 inches. A 4x  digital zoom further increases magnification at lower resolutions. Images are  stored on a Type I CompactFlash card (8 MB card included). Maximum image  resolution is 2,048 x 1,536 pixels, and an uncompressed TIFF mode is available  (remember, however, that uncompressed images are so large that you'll need a  bigger memory card to store even one full-resolution uncompressed  image).Though the camera defaults to full-auto point-and-shoot mode, it has a  host of manual features for advanced photographers. In addition, Nikon has  included 11 special modes in which the camera is automatically programmed with  the appropriate settings for specific situations like sunsets, beaches, night  portraits, and extreme close-ups. For example, switch the camera to its  party/indoor setting, and it will slow down the shutter and use a slow-synch  flash with red-eye reduction.The 880 is Nikon's smallest digital camera, with  overall dimensions of only 3.9 by 3 by 2.1 inches, and weighs only 9.7 ounces  without a battery.Power is provided by either a disposable 2CR5 lithium  battery (included) or an optional rechargeable lithium-ion battery. For  environmental and economic reasons, we strongly recommend getting the  rechargeable battery kit for anything more than occasional use.Image transfer  is quick and easy with the included USB cable. If you have an older computer  with only a serial port, the Coolpix 880 also supports serial image transfer  (though you'll need to purchase the serial cable separately). The camera ships  with an impressive software suite that includes Genuine Fractals 2.0 LE for file  compression and scaling, Cumulus 5.0 demo for image management, and Great Photo!  for image manipulation and correction.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CPJ6FD6AL._SX300_.jpg,15.67,,Electronics,Camera & Photo,Digital Cameras,Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,,

Canon EOS ELAN 7E 35mm SLR Camera Kit w/ 28-90mm Lens,"The Canon Elan 7E features the eye-controlled focus system, the fastest means of focusing and metering a photographer can find. By using more focusing points and greater off-center coverage than other cameras in its class, this camera is able to take an exact reading in approximately 1/20 of a second. When a photographer brings the camera to their eye, their glance is tracked by the focusing system, allowing framing and focusing to become a single uninterrupted creative process. An easy one-time calibration is all that's needed to activate the eye-controlled focus system. Once this calibration is complete, the camera is able to precisely detect which part of the viewfinder the photographer is using. It then automatically focuses the lens with amazing accuracy.This system delivers crisp, sharply focused images whether the camera is in a vertical or a horizontal position. The Canon Elan 7E is even able to store the distinct calibrations of up to five different photographers. Using an EF 300mm f2.8 IS lens, it can track a subject moving at 186 mph until it's a mere 66 feet from the camera. This fast-focus system, combined with the ability to shoot at almost four frames per second, makes the Canon Elan 7E the perfect choice for capturing those demanding sporting events or special occasions when you don't want to miss a single moment. And, considering its continuous shooting speed, the Elan 7E is also remarkably quiet. This feature gives the photographer the opportunity to shoot the perfect wildlife scene without disturbing or scaring the subject.Part of the Elan 7E's focusing system is the seven-point wide-area autofocus. The eye-controlled focus system was designed to work especially with this precision feature. Seven focusing points are arranged in a wide cross pattern with a central ""cross-type"" sensor. The wider-than-usual area gives the photographer the ability to achieve a remarkably sharp, focused image instantly. This function works whether the subject is off-center, stationary, in motion, in low light, or even in low-contrast situations. The shot will still come out sharp and crisp, and without the need to recompose the shot. By using the focusing-point selection keys, the user is able to select any of the seven focus points simply by pressing a key. Representing a bold innovation in speed and usability, this feature gives an additional amount of image control back to the photographer.A highly advanced metering system, comprised of 35-zone evaluative metering sensors, is linked to the seven focusing points. Whether shooting indoors or outside, day or night, a seamless integration of exposure and focus ensures remarkable clarity and contrast in any image. This system gives the photographer accurate control over situations that combine light and shadow or that feature strong backlight. When metering subjects against very dark or very bright backgrounds, partial-area metering measures 10 percent of the viewfinder around the chosen focusing point. This provides accurate image results when dealing with shadows or highlights. The photographer can also use the Elan 7E's center-weighed metering function. This mode places greater emphasis on what it reads as the center of the frame by measuring the entire scene. No matter which function the photographer chooses, precision metering is guaranteed--whether the camera is in a vertical or horizontal position.Giving the photographer even more creative control is the command dial. This allows manual-control light, speed, aperture, and depth of field. Shutter priority lets the photographer choose the shutter speed, while the Elan 7E automatically selects the correct aperture. This function is especially useful when capturing action shots. With aperture priority, the photographer picks the aperture setting while the camera chooses the correct shutter speed. This is helpful when control over the depth of field is essential. Using the eye-controlled focus system to define the ""sharp zone,"" the photographer can calculate the precise depth of field automatically. It's even possible to check the depth of field using the preview button.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511KSTWF4VL._SX300_.jpg,17.12,,Electronics,Camera & Photo,Film Photography,Film Cameras,SLR Cameras,
Canon EOS Rebel 2000 Silver Date 35mm SLR Camera Deluxe Kit with 28-90mm Lens,"The new generation of Canon Rebel 35mm SLR camera, the 2000 Date EF 28-90mm silver deluxe camera, is smaller and lighter than any of its predecessors. Besides its sleek all-silver color (including the 28-90mm zoom lens) and comfortable new body design, this camera has a faster AF and quieter overall operation. Many of its other functions, such as a seven-point autofocus, 35-zone AE metering, quartz data time/date stamp, and depth-of-field preview, have been added or improved upon. The seven-point autofocus system, five across and one above and below the center focusing point, contains a completely renovated focusing algorithm that increases the AF speed, improving selection accuracy of the automatic focusing point.The high-speed selectable seven-point autofocus system is linked to the 35-zone metering system as well as Canon's exclusive E-TTL autoflash system. Focusing point selection is chosen by the camera when it is set on automatic, or by the user if the photographer chooses manual mode. If the camera is on automatic, the shutter will not release until it perceives that the image is in focus. However, manual mode gives the photographer the freedom to determine how sharply in focus he or she wants the image. The TTL full-aperture metering has three patterns available: evaluative metering, central partial metering (which covers approximately 95 percent of the finder area), and center-weighted average metering. Though center-weighted metering is available, it can be used only when the camera is set on manual. This 35-zone metering system allows the photographer more precise exposure control in all of the available metering modes.Though this camera comes complete with many standard features for the beginner, advanced functions are also available for the more experienced photographer. Among these features are: a choice of evaluative or partial metering patterns, AE lock, auto exposure bracketing, and multiple exposure. These features, coupled with the Rebel's convenient built-in retractable flash and 11 versatile shooting modes, give any photographer the creativity to capture landscapes, portraits, vacation moments, sporting events, and other special occasions.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518NAK4PRQL._SX300_.jpg,209,,Electronics,Camera & Photo,Film Photography,Film Cameras,SLR Cameras,

"Pretec DC-530 0.3MP Digital Camera, PC Camera, MP3 Player, Voice Recorder","You've decided that it's time to get a new electronic gadget--but which one? A digital camera sounds exciting, but an MP3 player would be fun, too. Of course, having a Webcam for videoconferencing might be neat, and, if you're a student, a digital voice recorder would be useful for taping lectures. With so many options, which should you choose? Thanks to Pretec, your decision-making worries are over. With the DC-530, you get all four devices in one cute pocketsize package.The instruction manual is quite thin, but the controls are intuitive and well arranged, so most users will probably never even glance at the directions. A power button, shutter release, and mode dial are located on the top of the unit, and there's a four-way rocker switch on the front, next to the LCD status display.Judging by the ""DC"" in the model name, it seems that Pretec considers the digital camera to be the most important of the camera's functions. Its 640 x 480 CMOS sensor, fixed-focus lens, automatic built-in flash, and optical viewfinder are all pretty standard fare for entry-level digital cameras. Images can be stored either in the 2 MB of internal memory or on the included 32 MB Type I CompactFlash card (which also holds MP3 music files). At this price, you don't get an LCD display for previewing and reviewing your shots, but there is a small LCD panel that lets you know how many shots are remaining, flash status, etc. Strangely, this panel is placed on the front of the camera, so you'll have to point the camera at yourself each time you want to check if the flash is on or see how many shots you have left.To share your photos with others, you can either view them on a TV (the connecting cable is included) or transfer them to your home computer. Image transfer is quick, thanks to the USB connection. Image quality is acceptable--not particularly detailed, but with reasonable color reproduction. The fixed-focus lens means you don't have to worry about blurry snapshots, though the lens doesn't deal well with close-ups. With a resolution of 640 x 480, the images will look OK as e-mailed pictures or Web-based photos, but even 4-by-6-inch prints will be unacceptably fuzzy. As with the Polaroid i-zone or a disposable camera, this is a camera you use to capture memories, not to become the next Ansel Adams. With the exception of the flash (which can be switched between ""auto"" and ""off""), every other function on the camera is preset or automatic: just point and shoot.Twist the mode knob to MP3, and you're ready to start listening to music. Depending upon recording quality, MP3 files require more or less 1 MB of memory per minute, so the camera's 32 MB card gives you around a half-hour of music. If you're hoping to bring more songs along, you can either record at a lower quality or purchase an additional memory card. The unit uses standard Type I CompactFlash cards, which are available in capacities of up to 256 MB. With the included software, song transfer was speedy and drag-and-drop simple. Though most of the other combination digital camera/MP3 players employ copy protection that forces owners to use proprietary software and cables to transfer files, the Pretec will also play CompactFlash cards that were recorded on a dedicated card reader/writer--there seems to be no copy protection at all, making it much easier for people to transfer files to and from the player.Like the digital camera, the MP3 player is quite basic, letting listeners adjust the volume, play, pause, rewind, and fast forward. You won't find any advanced features like shuffle, repeat, or tone adjustment. In MP3 mode, even the LCD display is quite basic--information is limited to volume and battery condition.When used as an audio recorder, the DC-530 saves sounds as an 8 kHz mono PCM ""wav"" file. Files take about 1 MB per minute of memory (unlike MP3 files, these aren't compressed). The recorder uses a built-in microphone, and you can play back your files through headphones or transfer them to your computer.The DC-530 comes with a comprehensive software suite, including MGI PhotoSuite III SE, Siren Jukebox Xpress, and MGI VideoWave SE. The package includes a belt-loop carrying pouch, headphones, software, two AA batteries, and cables to connect the unit to your computer and TV.Each of the four functions is pretty basic, but they work as advertised and are fun to use. For the same price as the DC-530, you could purchase a digital camera (or MP3 player, or Webcam) with more features, but taken as a whole, it's a reasonably priced and fun little gadget.Pros:All-in-one design means fewer items to tote around.Compact, lightweight, and stylish.No proprietary file formats or copy protection on MP3 player.Cons:LCD can't be seen when taking pictures.Minimal features in all modes.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QV23CWKZL._SY300_.jpg,47.99,,Electronics,Camera & Photo,Digital Cameras,Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,,

GeoDiscovery Geode GPS Springboard Module For Handspring Visor,"The GeoDiscovery Geode GPS Springboard module for Handspring Visor is an  interactive travel guide that easily snaps onto your Handspring Visor. It  incorporates a GPS receiver, a digital compass, and two memory expansion slots.  The SiRFstar II-based 12-channel global positioning system receiver has an  integrated antenna that enables the Geode to receive L1 C/A (course acquisition)  signals from any of the 24 GPS satellites orbiting the earth. The Geode uses  SiRF's FoliageLock technology, which provides a high level of signal sensitivity  and performance even in canyons, between buildings, and in dense foliage. It  also incorporates dual multipath rejection that eliminates stray data from  reflected signals. This feature boosts GPS accuracy in many environments where  the radio signals can bounce off rocks or buildings before reaching the Geode.Further enhancing the GPS accuracy of the Geode is the implementation of the  Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) developed by the Federal Aviation  Administration. It is a geographically expansive augmentation to the basic GPS  service. WAAS improves the accuracy, integrity, and availability of the basic  GPS signals to approximately 2 meters in the United States, northern Mexico, and  southern Canada.The Geode runs on two AA batteries and includes two MultiMediaCard slots capable  of holding at least 64 MB each of storage for maps and trip information.

Minolta Freedom Zoom 125 Panorama Date 35mm Camera w/Remote Control,"One of the tiniest and lightest advanced 35mm compact cameras around,  the Minolta Freedom Zoom 125 packs a lot of excellent features into its stylish,  streamlined aluminum shell (with plastic backing). The fully automatic Freedom  Zoom 125 boasts a 37.5-125mm zoom lens for wide angles and excellent close-ups  (sharp as close as 1.97 feet), along with a multi autofocus system, (so people  standing apart, for example, will still be in focus), and a three-segment light  metering system with a highly accurate AE sensor for great exposures under most  conditions. Also included is a remote with a working range of approximately  16.4 feet. It provides two shutter release modes: standard mode triggers the  shutter as soon as the button on the remote control is pressed, while the  delayed mode takes the exposure two seconds after the button is pressed. Now you  can include yourself in the shot without racing against the self-timer. And, so  you'll never again have to wonder when you took those pictures, the Freedom Zoom  125 comes with a time/date stamp.Minolta used state-of-the-art 3-D CAD design technology to incorporate so many  great features into such an ultracompact body. They also developed special  optics for this camera that use a low number of double-sided aspheric lenses  able to achieve high-quality pictures while not taking up much space. A trigonal  roof prism allows for a shorter viewfinder optical system, too. All in all, this  is an excellent camera if you want something that fits in most pockets, yet  takes high-quality photos to match those of most larger compact cameras. One  last feature Minolta is proud of for its uniqueness: the film-chamber lock  prevents the back of the camera from being opened when there is an active roll  of film inside--the back won't open until the roll of film has been fully  rewound.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41QSV5Z531L._SX300_.jpg,134.5,,Electronics,Camera & Photo,Film Photography,Film Cameras,Point & Shoot Film Cameras,

Pentax EI-200 2.11MP Digital Camera w/ 3x Optical Zoom,"Despite the fact that Hewlett-Packard has produced a number of successful digital cameras in the past and is one of the biggest manufacturers of photo-quality printers, the company's lack of experience in film cameras has made it difficult for the public to take them seriously in this field. To help change this perception, Hewlett-Packard has paired up with Pentax for its latest product, and each company has contributed its expertise. The result is a pair of identical cameras: the HP 618 and the Pentax EI 200. With the exception of labels, packaging, and included accessories, the two cameras are the same.The camera's basic specifications are pretty standard: 2-megapixel CCD, 3x Pentax optical zoom, CompactFlash storage (Type I or II, but no Microdrive support), and a 2-inch display. For advanced users, there are aperture and shutter priority modes, adjustable white balance, exposure metering, and adjustable ISO (100 and 200).If you like the look and feel of Pentax cameras, you'll appreciate the HP's styling. It's curvy, swoopy, classically designed, and feels very solid. Most people who saw the camera were impressed with its overall quality and were surprised to learn it was a digital.One of the camera's most intriguing (and underdocumented) features is its use of Digita. Digita is an operating system created specifically for digital cameras, allowing software developers to modify and improve the camera's functions. Past Digita cameras have suffered from slow performance, but the camera seems as quick as most other digital cameras on the market. The engineers did a great job of shipping the camera with a wide variety of menus and functions preinstalled, but Digita allows for even more flexibility. Potential applications of this technology range from task-specific features (time-lapse photography, preset exposure modes, and digital special effects, for example) as well as the ability to add new applications--there are even Digita video games available for download. Unfortunately, the manual includes no information about Digita, and we were unable to determine how to transfer Digita files to the camera. This is extremely powerful technology, but perhaps this ability was buried because the engineers felt that it was too complex for the average user.The camera makes extensive use of Hewlett-Packard's infrared technology. A remote control is included (handy for self-portraits, keeping the camera steady in low-light shots, and to play back ""slide shows"" on your TV), and the camera can wirelessly transfer images to select HP printers.If you're a fan of Pentax styling or own a Hewlett-Packard printer with infrared ability, this camera is a logical choice.Pros:Clean, classic, reassuringly solid designRemote control includedPentax lensInfrared transfer to select HP printersIntegrated lens coverCons:Digita abilities not documentedCompactFlash slot supports Type I and Type II cards, but doesn't recognize MicrodriveLarger and heavier than some point-and-shoot digital cameras",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4166EVRG8RL._SX300_.jpg,134.5,,Electronics,Camera & Photo,Digital Cameras,Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,,

Tiffen 49mm Linear Polarizer,"Polarizer filters give you several key creative features. They evenly increase color saturation of all colors (except black and white), creating deep, rich scenics. They add contrast for dramatic skies and ariel shots. They eliminate the whitish glare from highly reflected surfaces like glass and water. Polarizers are two part lenses that rotate, allowing you to select the degree of additional saturation, contrast and glare reduction desired. Tiffen polarizers are offered in standard and warm versions. Warm polarizers add Tiffen's exclusive 812 warming filter, giving portraits and scenics a warm and muted feel while retaining rich coloration. Polarizes come in two types: Circular -- for all types of cameras: required for beam splitting metering systems commonly found in auto-focus SLR's and in most curretn TTL Slr's. Linear -- for older metering systems. Tiffen polarizers are available in the follow variations: Standard Linear. Standard Circular. Warm Circular -- polarizer plus 812 warming filter.

Kodak DC3400 EZ 2 MP Digital Camera with 2xOptical Zoom,"The Kodak DC3400 was created to take the place of the DC280, one of  Amazon.com's top-selling digital cameras of all time. Essentially, Kodak  faithfully kept all of what made the DC280 such a great camera--2.1-megapixel  images, 2x optical zoom, and ease of use--and placed it in a new body with a  more traditional shape. The DC3400 has enjoyed some great reviews from  publications, which cite Kodak's trademark color saturation, the easy-to-use  menu system, and its resemblance to the popular DC280. The EZ Bundle includes a  32 MB picture card, a Kodak charger, and NiMH batteries.The 2.1-megapixel CCD captures images at resolutions of 1,760 x 1,168 or 896 x  592 pixels. At both resolutions, Kodak offers three levels of JPEG compression  to choose from. Files are saved to the included 10 MB CompactFlash card. The  built-in flash features auto, off, fill, and red-eye reduction modes.Kodak was aiming for the middle of the consumer market with the DC3400.  Essentially a point-and-shoot camera, the DC3400 features a degree of  customization not normally found in point-and-shoots. Exposure compensation (EV)  can be adjusted in increments of 0.5 EV, from +2 to -2 EV. You can select  center-weighted or multipattern metering. Multipattern metering takes samples  from the entire frame and averages the light values. You can adjust image  sharpness to one of three presets: sharp, standard, and soft. Also, white  balance can be set to auto, daylight, fluorescent, or tungsten.The 2x zoom of the DC3400 is perhaps its weakest point, but even that can be  overcome--if you don't mind the decrease in resolution required when you use the  3x digital zoom. All in all, the DC3400 is a good choice if you're looking for a  point-and-shoot digital camera with good image quality, saturated color, and a  certain level of customization.Pros:Easy-to-use point-and-shoot digital cameraAllows for a good amount of customizationKodak color saturationCons:2x optical zoom is a bit weak10 MB memory card will need to be upgraded quickly",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Z2EEFNQHL._SX300_.jpg,134.5,,Electronics,Camera & Photo,Digital Cameras,Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,,

In addition, the surfaces of the objective lenses are fully covered with a multilayer coating. All of these features combine to give you clear, sharp, high-contrast images, even under poor lighting conditions.The diopter compensation of 2x gives you the ability to adjust the binoculars to your own eyesight requirements. Because the diopter adjustment is independent of the focusing system, you only have to set it once. The binoculars' ergonomic design allows you to hold them for long periods without getting tired. They're covered with a durable, black rubber coating that gives them added protection and a sure grip.

Packed with features such as the CCDs, 12x optical zoom, pop-up flash, manual and automatic controls, and a large 3.5-inch LCD screen, aspiring moviemakers find a true performance camcorder at an agreeable price.LensThe lens boasts three separate CCD sensors, with each one dedicated to capturing a certain hue of the image. That means sharper imaging, 530 lines of resolution, with colors that are true to life. The SteadyShot function stabilizes the picture and reduces camera shake. The TRV950's optical zoom magnifies up to 12 times, which is enough for most purposes. Turn on the digital zoom, which electronically magnifies the optical image, and reach up to 150x.Digital StillsDigital stills can be stored on a Memory Stick that works independently from the DV tape system. The camera performs with 1-megapixel resolution, making it capable of sharp images that are up to 1,152 x 864 pixels in size.

The camera can also shoot in MPEG movie mode, storing 320 x 240 videos onto the memory stick.Inputs and OutputsThe TRV950 is equipped with the standard DV IEEE 1394 port (also known as FireWire) for a super-fast, lossless connection to a PC or other DV machines.

The traditional S-video and RCA connections are also provided for direct viewing on a television or VHS dubbing.The DCR-TRV950 comes with one 8 MB Memory Stick.

Remanufactured IBM ThinkPad T23 1.13 GHz Pentium III Notebook PC with 30 GB Hard Drive,"Built specifically for business road warriors, the remanufactured corporate-class IBM ThinkPad T23 is a lightweight, affordable notebook PC that helps you get the job done wherever you roam. The notebook is ideal for people who value reliable performance and a reasonable price, as it features all the basics but few extras. The laptop is built around a 1.13 GHz Intel Pentium III processor that offers enough speed for most projects, though it lags behind most newer notebooks. To preserve battery life, users can turn on the battery-optimizing mode, which reduces the MHz speed to approximately 80 percent of max performance, thus using roughly 50 percent as much power. The computer also comes with 128 MB of installed RAM to get you started, though more will likely be necessary to handle multimedia applications and business productivity suites (1 GB max capacity). Furthering the affordability theme is the 30 GB hard drive, which--though once impressive--is now one of the smallest hard drives you'll find in the latest computers. However, it offers more than enough room for home productivity software, storing family photos, and maintaining a decent-sized digital audio library.The ThinkPad T23's video and graphics are powered by 16 MB of video RAM, which provides a maximum resolution of 1024 x 768 pixels on the 14.1-inch screen. The notebook also features support for SoundBlaster audio applications, with full-duplex audio on the system board, an integrated microphone that allows for voice annotation, and audio in/out jacks for stereo speakers or a headphone. To ensure that you have access to CDs and DVD movies while on the road, IBM included a DVD-ROM drive. The drive offers an ideal way to bring along additional data or audio/video files when on a business trip. Rounding out the peripheral set is a standard 86-key keyboard and TrackPoint two-button touchpad mouse.Additional features include an integrated 56k modem and a 10/100 Ethernet port (for connecting to LAN networks and DLS cable modems); an integrated wireless 802.11b connection that lets you connect to a LAN without wires or cables; a rechargeable lithium ion battery with a 3.5-hour battery life; two USB 2.0 ports for connecting to digital cameras, MP3 players, and other peripherals; and such jacks as an enhanced parallel port, a serial port, a VGA monitor port, an S-video out, a PS/2 port, and two PC card slots (for two Type I/II or one Type III card).The ThinkPad T23 comes with a preinstalled Windows 2000 Pro operating system. And as with all remanufactured items, the notebook boasts a 90-day warranty on parts and labor.What's in the BoxThinkPad T23 notebook PC, rechargeable lithium-ion battery, AC adapter, user's manual.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4147S9MGDDL._SY300_.jpg,134.5,,Electronics,Computers & Accessories,Laptops,,,

GoVideo DDV3110 Dual Deck 4-Head Hi-Fi VCR,"Do you have a lot of home movies on cassette that need to be edited and copied? Do you have a lot of shows that you tape regularly? Make your life easier with this dual-deck, 4-head VCR from GoVideo. With the DDV3110, you get all of the advantages of having two VCRs without the connection headaches, all in a component that isn't much bigger than a regular VCR. Each deck features 4-head recording to ensure superior picture and sound.With two decks in one unit, you can now record up to 12 hours of programs at a time. You can schedule up to 16 shows in advance with the recording timer. You'll never be left hanging by a recording that cuts off too early--the DDV3110 offers a feature that automatically adjusts the tape speed while recording in timer mode, fitting the entire program onto the tape.Skipping unwanted material is easier than ever with the DDV3110. The Commercial Advance feature automatically marks commercials while recording. When you play back the tape, the VCR will fast forward past the commercials. You can even opt to have a blue screen appear during the commercial skip, so you never have to see another ad. Although the DDV3110 can handle the process automatically, you retain the option to control the recording and playback yourself.When dubbing tapes recorded with the Commercial Advance feature, the commercials will not be copied onto your edited tape. When using the commercial-free copy mode, you can record a show in deck one, and have the DDV3110 automatically create a cleaned-up dub copy in deck two.When you are watching a prerecorded videocassette, you can jump straight to the movie with GoVideo's Movie Advance feature. The DDV3110 will prompt you to skip each or every preview at the beginning of the tape. The remote features a jog/shuttle dial that gives you even greater control over what you watch. Along with the automatic skip features, you can fast-forward and reverse with great precision at high speed or even frame by frame.Home-movie makers will find a number of features on the DDV3110 that are perfect for creating an impressive final cut. The VCR allows you to create onscreen titles for your movies that can vary in length and onscreen time. With the automatic editing function, you can flag up to eight scenes that you want to use on your final copy. The DDV3110 will do all the work for you in the dubbing process. You can add new music or narration to your movie as well. Simply connect your audio source to the front or back audio/video inputs.Setup is simple. Your available channels will automatically be set as soon as you turn on the DDV3110 for the first time. Composite-video outputs provide a quick connection from VCR to TV or to your home theater receiver. Front inputs allow for easy connections of camcorders and audio sources when you are editing tapes. An easy-to-use, onscreen menu lets you customize your setup by identifying the components plugged into the DDV3110.What's in the BoxDual deck VCR, coaxial cable, remote control, two AA batteries, owner's manual.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31HWSB9RM3L._SX300_.jpg,155.26,,Electronics,Television & Video,VCRs,,,
Olympus Camedia D-550 3MP Digital Camera w/ 2.8x Optical Zoom,"Sporting a similar design to previous Olympus D-series digicams, the D-550 Zoom features a 3-megapixel CCD, 2.8x optical zoom, and a 3.6x digital zoom. With its familiar film-camera style and high-resolution imagery, the D-550 is a great choice for vacation photos as well as family snapshots.Optics and ResolutionThe DS-550's 3-megapixel sensor captures ample detail for sharp prints at sizes up to 8 by 10 inches. For a serious amateur photographer, 3 megapixels is a great resolution, providing enough detail to perform some cropping and still have crisp prints.The all-glass autofocus Olympus lens has a 2.8x zoom range that's equivalent to a 36-100mm zoom lens on a 35mm camera. For technophiles, its aperture ranges from f2.9 to f4.4 depending on the zoom setting, with a normal focal range from 2.6 feet to infinity. There's also a 3.6x digital zoom, but remember that digital zoom tends to reduce the sharpness and detail of your image, so it's best used sparingly.To compose your images, either use the traditional camera viewfinder or the 1.8-inch LCD display (also used to review the shots you've taken). Having both types of viewfinders offers the best of both worlds: if you're used to a film camera or want to conserve battery life, use the viewfinder. If you want to see exactly the picture you'll be capturing, use the LCD display.More FeaturesA sliding clamshell lens cover simultaneously protects the D-550's lens and provides a simple way to turn the camera on and off, and the all-plastic body feels both lightweight and durable. While the D-550 offers automatic settings for point-and-shooters and beginning photographers, there are several manual features for more adventurous photographers, including macro mode, adjustable white-balance settings, exposure compensation, and the ability to shoot black-and-white and sepia images.PowerPower is provided by four AA batteries (alkalines are included). We recommend getting a set or two of rechargeable nickel metal hydride (NiMH) batteries and a charger. A digital camera will kill a set of alkaline batteries extremely quickly, especially if you're using the camera's LCD display, so they aren't recommended except in a pinch. To ensure you'll always be ready for action, we recommend having two sets of rechargeables so you can always have one set in the camera and the other set in the charger.Movie ModeIn movie mode, the camera captures silent video clips at resolutions of either 320 x 240 pixels (up to 33 seconds per movie) or 160 x 120 pixels (up to 148 seconds per movie). The limited duration and resolution of your movies guarantees that this feature won't replace your camcorder, but it's perfect for when you just want to capture a quick movie and e-mail it to a friend or relative.Storage and TransferImages are stored on SmartMedia memory cards. The included 16 MB card holds approximately 21 images at the camera's default settings. SmartMedia cards are reusable, but if you tend to take more than 21 images per outing (or plan to use the video feature much), then you'll want a bigger card. A 64 MB card will store well over 100 pictures. With most cameras, the brand of memory card you use is irrelevant, but genuine Olympus cards have a panorama feature not found on cards from other manufacturers. This feature makes it easier to stitch together a series of pictures you've taken into a single panoramic photo, and may justify the slightly higher price of the card if it's a feature you plan to use frequently.To transfer images to your computer, simply attach the included USB cable between your PC and your camera. Your computer should automatically recognize your camera and let you move the pictures to your hard drive.SizeAt 4.6 by 2.6 by 2 inches and 8.5 ounces, the D-550 is fairly thin and small, making it easy to bring along on outings--but it won't easily fit in your shirt pocket.Contents and Recommended AccessoriesThe package includes the camera, 16 MB SmartMedia card, four AA alkaline batteries, USB cable, video cable, carrying strap, and software on CD.Everything you need to get started is included in the box, but we recommend these accessories to make the most of your camera: a carrying case, a set of NiMH rechargeable size AA batteries, and a higher-capacity SmartMedia memory card.

Altec Lansing XA3001 Powered Subwoofer for TV and Gaming,"Is something missing from your gaming or TV viewing? Bring newfound realism and excitement to your audio/video entertainment while conserving valuable floor space with Altec Lansing's XA3001 powered subwoofer. Its powerful 19 watts (RMS) and deep bass output provide the affordable slam you've been looking for. Don't be fooled by its small, 8 x 8-inch footprint. The XA3001's single 5.25-inch driver and ported (bass-reflex) enclosure deliver subterranean bass rated to hit a room-rattlingly low 20 Hz (3 dB down from reference).Keep in mind that this is not a traditional home theater subwoofer optimized for the dynamic "".1"" output of a 5.1-channel surround system. Altec Lansing's recommended connection method for hookup with your TV lets you use your television's controls to adjust the volume on both the TV and the subwoofer. This connection method has 3 requirements, however: your TV must have RCA-type audio outputs; your TV's speakers must not automatically mute when using those audio outputs; and the TV's outputs must bevariable-leveloutputs controlled by the TV's remote.Alternately, you can wire the XA3001 inline between your audio source (gaming system, DVD player, VCR, etc.) and your TV. With this hookup, your TV's volume control will not affect the XA3001's output level. Simply run the audio and composite-video output from your source component into the sub's AV input jacks, then use a supplied AV cable to channel the signal from the sub's AV outputs to your TV.A phase-invert switch simplifies positioning by freeing you to place the speaker in places where it might otherwise be out of phase with your other speakers (that is, the sub's cone would be ""pushing"" when your speakers' cones are ""pulling,"" or vice-versa). This switch allows you to maximize your bass level by matching the XA3001's polarity with your TV speaker's polarity.You may mount the sub vertically or horizontally.What's in the BoxSubwoofer, a 10-foot stereo analog audio/composite-video RCA cable, an AC/DC power adapter, a user's manual, and a quick-connect card.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31R8JEMZP5L._SY300_.jpg,39.99,,Electronics,Computers & Accessories,Cables & Accessories,Computer Speakers,,

Sony MZ-N1 Net MD Walkman Player/Recorder with USB,"Sony's original top-of-the-line Net MD Walkman, the MZ-N1, lets you record MP3s or audio CDs directly to minidisc at up to 32x speed using a USB connection so you can transfer 80 minutes of music from PC to MD in less than three minutes. An included USB docking cradle simplifies uploads and battery charges. Now, affordable MD media can store more than five hours of music per standard 80-minute minidisc. Using the included rechargeable battery and one ""AA"" type battery, the player achieves up to 110 hours (more than four straight days) of continuous playback.The MZ-N1's compact magnesium body weighs just over three ounces. Creating custom music mixes is easy with the help of the player/recorder's backlit LCD, editing remote, and three-line dot matrix display (which shows nine characters per line). And, using the convenient Jog Dial navigator, you can scroll through a disc's contents to find desired songs and groups. Just rotate the dial with one finger and push it when you're ready to make a selection.The included software supports multiple Internet audio formats (including MP3 and WMA), which it converts to ATRAC3 format for storage on minidisc. ATRAC (Adaptive Transform Acoustic Coding) is the data-compression scheme developed for minidisc, and ATRAC3--the format used by Sony's Memory Stick--offers even greater compression while maintaining near-CD quality.TheSimple Burner QuickRipCD-dubbing application facilitates fast transfer of CDs to MD--without the need to store files on a hard drive as an interim step. Simply launch the application and select the tracks you want to transfer to the player. (The actual transfer speed depends on your PC.)You can record in standard mode for the richest sound quality or two different long-play modes for the most effective use of space. The bundledOpenMG Jukeboxmanagement software supports secure music downloads (including tracks from pressplay.com), titles tracks, and organizes playlists. As with all MD products, the MZ-N1 can record from various sources (there's a microphone input as well as a .125-inch input for either digital- or analog-audio connection) and offers flexible audio editing tools. Minidisc media is affordable, durable, and re-recordable up to a million times without degradation.

Microsoft Optical Mouse (Blue),"The Microsoft Optical Mouse Blue is a well-designed, stylish, and efficient mouse that makes a worthy addition to any desktop. This mouse is shaped for ambidextrous use, fitting comfortably in either hand. It features two buttons and a central scroll wheel, and its silver and blue two-tone finish is complemented by the signature red glow characteristic of the Microsoft optical family.The mouse connects via USB, though a PS/2 converter is also supplied. The package comes with IntelliPoint 4.1 software, which is straightforward to install. It works with Windows 98 and all later versions of Windows, and is also compatible with Mac OS 8.6, 9x, and 10.1. Unlike traditional mice, the Microsoft Optical Mouse Blue doesn't contain a ball, but instead uses a high-intensity LED and optical sensor to detect movement. This negates the need for regular cleaning, as with a mouse ball, and also provides greater precision.During testing, the Microsoft Optical Mouse Blue performed well.

Cambridge SoundWorks Newton Series MC50 Satellite Speaker (White),"Over a decade of design experience has gone into the new Cambridge SoundWorks' Newton Series MC50 satellite speaker, which is why it is perhaps the finest example of a high performance, ultra-compact satellite speaker available today.This incredible satellite starts with a Newton Series matte-finished ABS cabinet. Matching the curves of our Newton Series speakers not only makes a great looking satellite speaker, but also makes it sound better. Asymmetrically curved satellite cabinets all but eliminate distortion-causing reflections known as standing waves.The MC50 satellite cabinet is also slightly larger than our previous satellite speaker designs. By combining this larger cabinet design with a new smaller (but more powerful) Neodymium-magnet motor structure, we have dramatically increased the air space inside the speaker cabinet -- and more air space means flatter, deeper frequency response and better sound.Thanks to a new, larger 3 1/2-inch driver and a four-element EQ network built into each satellite, MC50 speakers range from as high as 16kHz and down below 150Hz, covering the mid- and high-end of the frequency range beautifully and evenly right down to where any one of our subwoofers can take over.

"Cambridge SoundWorks New Ensemble II Home Theater Speaker System, Charcoal","The New Ensemble II Home Theater system by Cambridge SoundWorks is centered around their best-value high-performance subwoofer/satellite speaker music system, and adds their most affordable low-profile center speaker, the Center Channel II, and two Surround II 5.1 MultiPole surround speakers.The front channel speakers in this system incorporate long-throw mid-bass/mid-range speakers and a 1 &#xBE; direct radiator tweeters. Using separate drivers for the mid and high frequencies allows each speaker to specialize in producing one part of the signal. The mid-range speaker responds low enough to eliminate gaps between the satellites and the subwoofer. Bass signal is sent to the New Ensembles II's dual 6 1/2 driver subwoofer. The passive sub uses a bandpass filter -- a two-part filter that cuts highs and lows to leave a band in the middle.The center channel speaker in the New Ensemble II Home Theater is Cambridge SoundWorks' Center Channel II, a low profile, two-way acoustic suspension speaker tonally matched to the satellites used in the New Ensemble II main speakers. The Center Channel II has wide dispersion, smooth tonal balance and good power handling. Because of its compact size and shielding, it's easy to place it on top of, or below a TV. Center Channel II uses two-long throw 3 1/2 mid-bass drivers and a tweeter which is identical to that used in a New Ensemble II satellite.The rear channel effects are brought to life with Cambridge SoundWorks' Surround II 5.1 speakers. The Surround II 5.1 uses MultiPole technology so it can be switched from dipole (diffuse radiation) to bipole (direct radiation) operation. The MultiPole switch on the Surround II 5.1 alters the directionality of the speaker. Dipole mode sends the mid and high frequency output along the side walls, so all the listeners hear a diffuse, enveloping sound. Bipole mode concentrates this output toward the listening area, providing central listeners more precise imaging.The New Ensemble II Home Theater is a great value. It provides excellent musical detail and accuracy, while doubling as a very impressive yet inconspicuous surround sound speaker system.In White with a Charcoal center channel.

Hook it up to your computer or portable CD/radio (anything with a headphone jack) for sound that rivals most home stereo systems. Designed by audio pioneer Henry Kloss, MicroWorks is a multimedia speaker system with incredibly accurate sound that actually has more power, more output and more bass than a lot of home stereo systems.Henry Kloss has carefully fine-tuned MicroWorks to produce its natural, accurate, wide-range sound. This process includes tailoring its built-in amplifier to optimize the speakers' performance. The built-in amplifier features 67 watts total, making it more powerful than similar systems. And its subwoofer and satellite drivers are larger. The result: MicroWorks has over four times the acoustic output of most multimedia speaker systems. Deeper and stronger bass response along with the clear, wide-range sound enable MicroWorks to easily fill a living room, a conference room, even a small auditorium, with beautiful music. It's terrific for making multimedia presentations on your computer.Yet MicroWorks takes up very little desk space. Its compact shielded satellites fit just about anywhere. Use their supplied stands or hang them on the wall (hardware included). The subwoofer has a very minimal footprint, only half of a square foot. Since it reproduces only non-directional bass it can be placed out of the way- behind your TV, under your desk or behind furniture. Just connect it to anything with a headphone jack. Or hook it up to the audio output jacks on your stereo TV to create a great two-channel home theater system.

These state-of-the-art surrounds use MultiPole technology so they can be switched from dipole (diffuse radiation) to bipole (direct radiation) operation. This makes them the ideal speakers for use with any surround sound system, especially Dolby Digital systems which send distinctly different signals to the right and left surround speakers. The MultiPole switch on the Surround 5.1 alters the directionality of the speaker. Dipole mode sends the mid- and high-frequency output along the side walls, so all the listeners hear a diffused, enveloping sound. Bipole mode concentrates this output toward the listening area, providing central listeners more precise imaging.

"Cambridge SoundWorks MicroWorks Amplified Speaker System by Henry Kloss, Computer Beige","PC Magazine calls Cambridge SoundWorks' MicroWorks the only speakers you'll ever need. Hook it up to your computer or portable CD/radio (anything with a headphone jack) for sound that rivals most home stereo systems. Designed by audio pioneer Henry Kloss, MicroWorks is a multimedia speaker system with incredibly accurate sound that actually has more power, more output and more bass than a lot of home stereo systems.Henry Kloss has carefully fine-tuned MicroWorks to produce its natural, accurate, wide-range sound. This process includes tailoring its built-in amplifier to optimize the speakers' performance. The built-in amplifier features 67 watts total, making it more powerful than similar systems. And its subwoofer and satellite drivers are larger. The result: MicroWorks has over four times the acoustic output of most multimedia speaker systems. Deeper and stronger bass response along with the clear, wide-range sound enable MicroWorks to easily fill a living room, a conference room, even a small auditorium, with beautiful music. It's terrific for making multimedia presentations on your computer.Yet MicroWorks takes up very little desk space. Its compact shielded satellites fit just about anywhere. Use their supplied stands or hang them on the wall (hardware included). The subwoofer has a very minimal footprint, only half of a square foot. Since it reproduces only non-directional bass it can be placed out of the way- behind your TV, under your desk or behind furniture. Just connect it to anything with a headphone jack. Or hook it up to the audio output jacks on your stereo TV to create a great two-channel home theater system.

ReplayTV RTV4508 80-Hour Digital Video Recorder,"A ReplayTV DVR (digital video recorder) makes it simple to record favorite shows without the complicated programming requirements of VCRs and without videotape hassles. The result? You are freed from set TV schedules, and you watch what you want, when you want. ReplayTV connects nightly to the ReplayTV service to download the latest channel guide information. You use this intuitive channel guide and main menu to follow simple--and in many cases, one-button--prompts. Because ReplayTV uses digital recording to store live television on a hard drive as you're watching, you'll also be able to control live TV. You can pause live TV to take a telephone call, rewind to see a scene again, use instant replay to jump back seven seconds, or watch a scene in slow motion.With the ReplayTV 4508, you can connect to the ReplayTV service through a high-speed broadband Internet connection or an analog mode. And regardless of how you connect, you'll enjoy all the benefits this DVR offers, including one-button recording of favorite shows and the option to watch recorded shows without commercials. Plus, you get up to 80 hours of storage capacity. If you forget to program the receiver to record a show before leaving for vacation, no worries--access your ReplayTV over the Web and program it from anywhere.If you connect to the ReplayTV service through a high-speed broadband Internet connection, you'll be able to share recorded programs with friends and family who have ReplayTV 4500-series components. And, if you have a home network, it's easy to connect a ReplayTV and stream video from room to room between multiple ReplayTVs, or share digital photos between a PC and a ReplayTV. With two ReplayTV 4500-series models in a home connected via the unit's Ethernet port, you can watch recorded programs stored on either unit. So, if you're using the upstairs ReplayTV 4500 unit and you want to watch a program that was recorded on the downstairs unit, no problem--just select it. Other features include commercial advance, show organizer, conflict resolver, progressive-scan output, digital-audio output, and a backlit remote control.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31SHS6S3WVL._SX300_.jpg,134.5,,Electronics,Television & Video,Streaming Media Players,,,
Cambridge SoundWorks Newton Series MC50 Satellite Speaker (Slate) (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"Over a decade of design experience has gone into the new Cambridge SoundWorks' Newton Series MC50 satellite speaker, which is why it is perhaps the finest example of a high performance, ultra-compact satellite speaker available today.This incredible satellite starts with a Newton Series matte-finished ABS cabinet. Matching the curves of our Newton Series speakers not only makes a great looking satellite speaker, but also makes it sound better. Asymmetrically curved satellite cabinets all but eliminate distortion-causing reflections known as standing waves.The MC50 satellite cabinet is also slightly larger than our previous satellite speaker designs. By combining this larger cabinet design with a new smaller (but more powerful) Neodymium-magnet motor structure, we have dramatically increased the air space inside the speaker cabinet -- and more air space means flatter, deeper frequency response and better sound.Thanks to a new, larger 3 1/2-inch driver and a four-element EQ network built into each satellite, MC50 speakers range from as high as 16kHz and down below 150Hz, covering the mid- and high-end of the frequency range beautifully and evenly right down to where any one of our subwoofers can take over.

The subwoofer cabinet encloses a 5 3/4-inch woofer in an acoustic suspension cavity, firing into a bandpass filter cavity for improved bass efficiency.Due to their small size, the satellites can be hung on a wall using their supplied keyhole slots, or placed on shelves or stands, making them blend into most decors.

"Cambridge SoundWorks The Surround 5.1 Surround Speaker (Pair), Charcoal (Discontinued by Manufacturer)","The Cambridge SoundWorks Surround 5.1 surround sound speakers feature more output than their smaller counterparts, the Surround II 5.1, and are suggested for use with most surround sound systems. These state-of-the-art surrounds use MultiPole technology so they can be switched from dipole (diffuse radiation) to bipole (direct radiation) operation. This makes them the ideal speakers for use with any surround sound system, especially Dolby Digital systems which send distinctly different signals to the right and left surround speakers. The MultiPole switch on the Surround 5.1 alters the directionality of the speaker. Dipole mode sends the mid- and high-frequency output along the side walls, so all the listeners hear a diffused, enveloping sound. Bipole mode concentrates this output toward the listening area, providing central listeners more precise imaging. For all Dolby Pro Logic Recordings and most current Dolby Digital recordings we recommend the dipole mode. For some Dolby Digital recordings such as those with lots of lateral sound positioning crafted into the rear channels, the bipolar mode is a better choice.Charcoal, also available in White.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/11K38GDBPQL.jpg,134.5,,Electronics,Home Audio,Stereo Components,Speakers,Speaker Systems,

This system allows you to view up to four camera locations in multiple viewing options such as quad, sequential, or picture-in-picture. The four included cameras are not only weather-resistant, but have built-in PIR motion sensors that alert you of camera activity. Featuring two-way audio, remote control, and other advanced functions, the Lorex SG14Q5044-A is a complete, feature-rich, self-contained surveillance system perfect for everything from the home or business application, to professional security installations.The SG14Q5044-A's 14-inch color monitor can be operated via its built-in main panel or via the included remote control. Constructed within a durable metal cabinet, this monitor includes four DIN/BNC (Bayonet Neill-Concelman, RF-type) composite video inputs, and four RCA audio inputs. Also included are four alarm inputs with one alarm output. Multi-voltage compatible, the SG14Q5044-A's monitor runs on 110- to 220-volts of power, and achieves 380 TVL (TV lines) at center resolution at up to 30 frames per second (frames per second). This monitor has an operating temperature of 32- to 104-degrees Fahrenheit.The four cameras that comes with the SG14Q5044-A utilize 0.25-inch color CCD (charge-coupled device) image sensors, and 3.6mm fixed lenses. Powered from the monitor via the connecting cables, these cameras achieve a horizontal resolution of 350 TVL with 510 by 492 active picture elements. Constructed of durable ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) plastic, these cameras can receive a usable picture in low-light conditions with a minimum illumination of one Lux. The SG14Q5044-A's cameras come with their own 63-foot connection cables allowing you to install them virtually anywhere, and can operate in temperatures ranging from 14- to 122-degrees Fahrenheit.Technical Features:Camera lenses: 3.6mm fixedImage sensor: 0.25-inch color CCDSensitivity: minimum illumination of 1 LuxResolution: monitor 380 TVL at 30 frames per second, camera 350 TVLOperating temperature: 14 - 122 degrees Fahrenheit for camera; 32 - 104 degrees Fahrenheit for monitorMonitor dimensions: 14 x 15 x 13 inches (W x D x H)Camera dimensions: 2.25 x 2.5 x 3.33 inches (W x D x H)Designed primarily for indoor use, the Lorex SG14Q5044-A offers you everything you need in a security surveillance system. The SG14C6044A allows up to four cameras to be controlled, viewed, and recorded all by a single unit. User's should note that the CCD image sensor in the camera may become permanently damaged if exposed to long hours of direct sunlight or halogen light, so the cameras should not be mounted or pointed directly at the sun or other bright-light sources.About Surveillance Camera Technical FeaturesLux ratingis the measurement used to indicate how sensitive a camera is to light, and stands for the level of light reflected off a piece of paper by a candle from one meter away. Thus a sensitivity of three Lux would mean a camera could generate an acceptable picture of a piece-of-paper-sized object that was illuminated by the equivalent of three candles from one meter away. The lower the Lux level, the better the camera's ability to work in low-light conditions. The camera'sresolutionshould be greater than or equal to the resolution supported by the system's recorder or monitor. TheS/N, orsignal to noise ratio, is an important measure of a camera's quality. A poor camera, low-light conditions or poor wiring causes ""noise"" which consumes processing power and disk space. A camera with a widedynamic rangeis ideal, especially for recording areas in which both indoor and outdoor light are present.CCD (charge-coupled device) sensorsprovide high-quality images that are less susceptible to noise.CMOS (complimentary metal-oxide semiconductor) sensorsoffer less image quality, but are usually more cost-effective and energy efficient.What's in the BoxColor quad monitor, remote control, 4 x cameras, 4 camera stands, 4 cables (56 feet), and installation hardware.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41QQFQWRNWL._SX300_.jpg,134.5,,Electronics,Security & Surveillance,Surveillance Video Equipment,Video Multiplexers & Quads,,
