The result is a sturdy stand that gives you the option of using your NOOK hands-free in landscape orientation, in either video-viewing mode or typing mode. (The viewing mode offers a more vertical angle.) Proving that this is a smart cover in every sense, it also puts your NOOK HD into sleep mode when you close the front flap and wakes it up when the flap is opened.

Type A to C digital cable supports up to 600Hz, 1.4 and 1.3 standards.Higher Speed: HDMI 1.3 increases its single-link bandwidth to 340 MHz (10.2 Gbps) to support the demands of future HD display devices, such as higher resolutions, Deep Color and high frame rates. In addition, built into the HDMI 1.3 specification is the technical foundation that will let future versions of HDMI reach significantly higher speeds.Deep Color: HDMI 1.3 supports 10-bit, 12-bit and 16-bit (RGB or YCbCr) color depths, up from the 8-bit depths in previous versions of the HDMI specification, for stunning rendering of over one billion colors in unprecedented detail.Broader color space: HDMI 1.3 adds support for ?x.v.Color?? (which is the consumer name describing the IEC 61966-2-4 xvYCC color standard), which removes current color space limitations and enables the display of any color viewable by the human eye.This New version of mini connector: With small portable devices such as HD camcorders and still cameras demanding seamless connectivity to HDTVs, HDMI 1.3 offers a new, smaller form factor connector option.New HD lossless audio formats: In addition to HDMI?s current ability to support high-bandwidth uncompressed digital audio and all currently-available compressed formats (such as Dolby? Digital and DTS?), HDMI 1.3 adds additional support for new lossless compressed digital audio formats Dolby trueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio?.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41P05QkC4EL._SY300_.jpg,6.38,,Electronics,Accessories & Supplies,Audio & Video Accessories,Cables & Interconnects,Video Cables,HDMI Cables

Expoimaging 82mm Expodisc Neutral White Balance Filter,"Get accurate color in difficult lighting with the patented ExpoDisc, the fast and easy digital white balance filter.Simply read and set white balance with the ExpoDisc in place before shooting and you&rsquo;ll reduce or eliminate the need for post-capture color adjustments.Get the white balance solution that is quickly becoming the preferred method of achieving accurate color balance for professional photographers today.Here is how it works:Varying levels of colorcast typically occur in digital photography and require compensation as part of the process to create a photograph with good color fidelity. Until now, photographers have had to rely on gray/white cards to solve this problem. The ExpoDisc is an easy to use custom white balance solution that eliminates the inconvenience and inconsistencies of other methods. It is a neutral diffusion filter that gathers ambient light and passively transmits 18% of it through to your camera&rsquo;s light meter, effectively producing a &lsquo;gray frame&rsquo;.You then set a custom white balance using the &lsquo;gray frame&rsquo; that results in accurate color in most lighting conditions.Your camera essentially compensates for and neutralizes the colorcast it sees through the ExpoDisc.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41nJi5eC-qL._SX300_.jpg,44.95,,Electronics,Camera & Photo,Accessories,Filters & Accessories,Color Correction & Compensation Filters,
Minolta Vectis 300 Beam APS Camera,"The Advanced Photo System (APS) has breathed new life into the design of point-and-shoot cameras. Thanks to a smaller film size (24mm) and a compact film cartridge, camera manufacturers have been able to design small, sleek cameras that fit comfortably into a shirt pocket. And with the Vectis 300, Minolta has not only designed a tiny camera, it's designed a camera that's just plain sexy.The Vectis 300 is encased in a distinctive, stainless steel body. The camera uses a 24-70mm zoom lens (equivalent to a 30-87.5mm lens on a 35mm camera) that's easily controlled by two buttons on the camera back. It includes both autofocus and focus-hold systems--you can focus on objects as close as 16 inches.  Select from five flash modes including red-eye reduction and fill. Depending on the film speed and zoom setting, the flash range extends to 20 feet. As with most APS cameras, you can select from three print formats: Classic (C--4 inches by 6 inches); HDTV (H--4 inches by 7 inches), and Panoramic (P--3.5 inches by 10 inches). Other features include a self-timer and time-date stamping and titling options, which are imprinted on the film's magnetic strip and can then be printed by the film lab on the front or back of your prints. A remote control can be purchased separately. Fun and easy to use, the Vectis 300 is about as good as it gets in point-and-shoot APS photography.--Harry C.

Olympus Stylus Zoom 115 QD DLX Date 35mm Camera,"Olympus has long been a leader in 35mm point-and-shoot cameras, and the Stylus Zoom 115 DLX is one reason why. Encased in the distinctive, clamshell design favored by Olympus, the Stylus Zoom 115 offers a 38-115mm zoom lens, six flash modes, spot focus, a panorama setting, and a host of other features that make it the toast of mid-range zoom cameras.To turn the camera on, simply slide open the clamshell lens cover--out pops the lens and flash unit and you're ready to shoot. Control the zoom lens using a small rocker switch that's conveniently located on the top right of the camera next to the large shutter release button. The Stylus Zoom 115 has an autofocus system that can take in subjects as close as 2 feet. The camera's focus-lock feature lets you selectively focus on subjects that are outside the camera's autofocus range. Flash modes include red-eye reduction and night flash; the flash range extends to 16 feet. The camera includes a self-timer, date-time stamp, and a diopter viewfinder adjustment designed for farsighted and nearsighted users. On top of all this, the Stylus Zoom 115 is weatherproof.

A mini jack allows you to plug the headphones into the standard jacks in airplane armrests, which will give you much better sound than the $5 disposables will for in-flight music services and movies.

But looks can be deceiving. It's actually a remarkably good-sounding compact system with far more substance than flash.The RS-1249 comes equipped with a three-disc drawer-type CD changer, a dual-well cassette deck, a digital AM/FM tuner with 32 presets, two-way speakers, and a full-function remote control. This unit is pleasingly intuitive to operate. Although you'll want to consult the manual for advanced functions, getting it up and running is easy. For example, the RS-1249 automatically senses your tape type (chrome, normal, etc.) and sets the recording level, so recording to cassette is essentially a one-button operation. The full-function remote is also a model of clean design.We were immediately impressed by the RS-1249's open and rich musical presentation. In fact, its sound is so seductively smooth and warm, we'd go as far as to use the word ""creamy."" Two other sonic qualities stand out: One is the RS-1249's ability to sound bigger than it is--we never felt like we were listening to just two small speakers. The other is the highly natural tones the RS-1249 brings to instruments and voices.The RS-1249's excellent digital tuner deserves special mention for its ability to capture stations and for its clear, static-free sound.If you're looking for a super-affordable, natural sounding, and easy-to-use compact system with just the right set of features, check out RCA's RS-1249.--Wayne GarciaPros:Full, seductive soundEasy to useRecording to cassette is a snapCons:Flashy panel display cannot be turned off",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41EWP5512JL._SX300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Home Audio,Compact Stereos,,,

The machine has three basic functions: CD player, cassette recorder/player, and AM/FM stereo radio.The CD player has all the features you'd expect from a model in this category--the ability to pause a track, skip forward and back, and review or cue through individual tracks. In addition, the RP-7968 has a shuffle feature that will randomly pick songs for you. A repeat function allows you to hear one favorite song over and over or to repeat the whole CD. When you use both the shuffle and repeat features together, the RP-7968 continues to play as long as the power holds out. One drawback we discovered was that the unit is surprisingly susceptible to skips when you move it during CD play.The cassette feature on this unit offers standard playback, as well as recording from either CD or radio. However, it does not offer a built-in microphone or an external microphone jack. The radio portion is limited by manual (as opposed to digital) tuning and a tiny frequency legend, but RCA's Automatic Frequency Control (AFC) helps bring in those hard-to-find stations.The machine also offers an intuitive Dynamic Bass Boost System (DBBS) button in lieu of Tone, Bass, and Treble knobs. There are two built-in, clear-sounding 4-inch speakers that, at full volume with DBBS, were a little overwhelmed by the internal amplifier. If you'll be using this unit in the den or the workplace, it's likely to have everything you need.Pros:Small, lightweight constructionAttractive designEasy, intuitive operationCons:CD player skips easily when movedDifficult to find exact frequencies with radio's manual tuner",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71EJKFRP3FL._SX300_.gif,,,Electronics,Portable Audio & Video,Boomboxes,,,

RCA RC930 Caller-ID-Compatible Wireless Modem Jack,"The RCA Wireless Modem Jack RC930 uses household electrical wiring to provide a simple solution for consumers who want to add a telephone jack to any room in the home or office. It can accommodate modem speeds up to 56K and is compatible with personal and laptop computers, caller ID units, and Internet access devices, in addition to corded and cordless phones, answering machines, fax machines, and digital satellite system receivers.The system consists of two units: a base and an extension. The base unit transmits the telephone signal on the electrical wiring using the FM band. It plugs into an electrical outlet near an existing telephone jack and connects to an existing telephone jack with a modular phone cord. The extension unit plugs into any electrical outlet and operates as a telephone jack. Once the base unit is plugged in, an unlimited number of extension units may be operated from the original base unit.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/716MTWZJSVL._SX300_.gif,64.99,,Electronics,Accessories & Supplies,Telephone Accessories,Wireless Jack Systems,,

RCA RC926 Wireless Phone Jack,"The RCA RC926 wireless phone jack converts your existing electrical outlet into a phone jack without the need for tools or wiring. Plus, it's fully expandable, allowing you to add as many additional RCA RC926 extension units as you need.The RC926 is very easy to install. Just insert the transmission unit into the AC wall outlet and connect the RJ-11 cable to the existing phone jack. Next, plug the included extension unit into the wall outlet. You can plug it into any outlet within your home. A green indicator light on the side of each unit indicates that it is functioning normally. A reset button lets you change the location of the phone jack or switch phones.The RC926 features built-in surge suppression and is ideal for placing a phone anywhere that an extension phone jack is not readily available. The RC926 is compatible with corded and cordless phones, answering machines, fax machines, and computer modems. It also supports call forwarding, call waiting, three-way calling, conference calling, and speed dialing.Once installed, the wireless phone jack system is fully expandable--you can add an unlimited number of extension units and phones throughout your home.--Megan Dugan",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71MZ8MME17L._SX300_.gif,38.99,,Electronics,Accessories & Supplies,Telephone Accessories,Wireless Jack Systems,,
Uniden HS910 Headset for Cordless Phones,"Take cordless convenience one step further with complete hands-free operation. Increase your productivity, work on other projects, and enjoy more freedom of movement, all without straining your neck trying to support a telephone handset.The HS910 is comfortable and lightweight; after a few minutes, you'll forget you're wearing it. The headset attaches to the cordless handset's 2.5mm headset jack. (We tested the unit on a Uniden EXS 9110, but it fits any 2.5mm-compatible cordless phone.) Once the headset is attached, you cannot use the handset for talking or listening, but you can us it to answer incoming calls and to dial. Having a belt clip on your cordless handset is especially helpful, giving your phone complete unobtrusive portability as you walk around.With the headset, your caller will hear your voice slightly softened compared with how you sound on the handset alone, but otherwise, the headset introduces no additional noise or distortion, and it doesn't reduce the handset's range or battery life. In our tests, even after an hour of continuous use, the headset had not become uncomfortable. For very long calls, you can rotate the headset, as the unit is designed for both left-ear and right-ear listening.The Uniden HS910 headset is a product that really works as advertised. It is a practical, comfortable accessory that frees you to pursue other activities as you talk on the telephone.--Mike BrownProsComfortableLightweightConsShort, 90-day warrantyA definite fashion-don't",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71ER9HRSNQL._SX300_.gif,45.99,Uniden,Electronics,Accessories & Supplies,Telephone Accessories,Headsets,,

RCA RC5220P DVD Player,"RCA's RC5220P DVD-video player is everything you'd want in a basic, budget model: a slim, lightweight player with extensive features at a good price. The RC5220P's S-video and composite-video outputs, well served by the player's state-of-the-art 10-bit digital video converters, deliver a clear, sharp image. This feature is excellent for a sub-$300 DVD player.In the audio realm, we found the RC5220P to sound as good as other players in its price range, with an above-average-sounding headphone jack. The player outputs both Dolby Digital and DTS surround-sound formats through a single, switchable Toslink optical connection. Because the Toslink is an optical connector, you need to make sure that your surround receiver or processor accepts optical inputs rather than the standard coaxial inputs. Some of the higher-end audio options that you forego by purchasing this lower-priced model are six-channel analog audio outputs and a more common digital connection type in a dedicated coaxial (rather than Toslink) output.Connection issues aside, the player offers a host of minor features that together help chisel ""bargain"" right across the RC5220P's name. Among these are parental lock-out, bookmarking, and RF-adapter capability. With parental lock-out, you can code the RC5220P to play no discs at all or only discs bearing certain user-determined ratings. Using bookmarks, the player can instantly recall up to 10 favorite moments within a DVD or CD. (Bookmarks clear when you remove the disc.) Finally, the RF adapter permits you to use the RC5220P with older televisions that may not have S-Video or composite-video inputs.Setup was quick and simple, taking only minutes from cracking open the box to enjoying a movie or CD. Programming was a breeze; the only primary programming feature not obvious from the get-go was the track-skip feature on the supplied remote control. But the clear, well-written manual clarified this. For dollar-conscious AV enthusiasts, you can't do much better.Pros:Good picture and soundTons of featuresEasy to integrate with older systemsRapid setupCons:Player froze up once during reviewFront panel display doesn't show DVD track numberHeadphone jack uses buttons rather than rotary knob",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31ME9PGT8ML._SX300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Television & Video,DVD Players & Recorders,DVD Players,,

Magellan GPS 315 Waterproof Hiking GPS,"Magellan's GPS 315 doesn't have a lot of advanced features, but it does provide positional and directional readings accurate enough to help you find your way back to base camp when you're out in the woods. This portable global positioning system is one of the most compact we've ever tested, and it features a crisp display for the pages of information it throws at users.The GPS 315 is designed more for outdoor use than car navigation and doesn't display road maps. It does have a database of over 15,000 cities and the capability to accept up to 500 user-defined waypoints, so it still works fairly well for giving you bearings to the next town or point of interest. We used the tracking features extensively, which let us leave a ""bread crumb"" trail as we traveled. This was especially helpful when we were backtracking along the same route, as we were able to easily compare our current position with the trail on the display.The display has two levels of backlighting, a feature that drains the unit's two AA batteries at a frightening rate. However, without the backlight on, we got more than 12 hours of use from the unit.The GPS 315 uses simple controls that let users page through its numerous data screens. As long as we were moving the compass, the screens worked well; we especially liked the graphical compass that pointed out our current direction of travel and the bearing to a waypoint at the same time. The device can also serve as a full-fledged trip computer, measuring distance, average speed, and providing an estimated time of arrival. Perhaps the best thing about the GPS 315 is that all the data screens are fully customizable, letting users create their own data pages containing only the data they want to see.Although Magellan doesn't include a lot of goodies in the box, the GPS 315 has many optional accessories that increase its capabilities. For example, you can get a PC cable to upload topographical and street map data. Without all the extras the GPS 315 is better suited for hikers and boaters than highway travelers, but it's an accurate and inexpensive way to keep your bearings.--T.

RCA WSP150 900 MHz Wireless Speakers (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"Chances are there's one or two places at home where you'd love to enjoy music without having to go to the trouble of laying the speaker wire (or drilling the holes) to get it there. And, short of strapping on a pair of headphones, your options are pretty limited. Fret no more: The WSP150 wireless powered speaker system from RCA lets you import music from CD, radio, DVD, or virtually any audio source to nearly any room in the house--the range is about 150 feet, even through most walls and floors.The WSP150 uses the FM (frequency-modulation) technique employed in radio to transmit audio to the two speakers, each of which houses its own 2-watt amplifier. The speakers each offer a roll-on power/volume switch and a tone control/bass boost button.The system comes with two main parts: the transmitter and the speakers, all of which require close proximity to an AC outlet, unless you opt to battery-power the speakers--perfect for outdoor use in nice weather (requires four D batteries per speaker, not included). The transmitter plugs into a wall outlet and hooks into your desired audio source via a single stereo minijack-to-RCA cable (supplied). Be aware that with no master balance knob, the two speakers must be manually adjusted for equal volume.What's in the BoxA transmitter, two stereo speaker/receivers, two DC power adapters (6V, for speakers), one DC power adapter (19V, for transmitter), an 8-inch Y cable adapter (.125-inch minijack to two RCA-type plugs), user's manual, and warranty information.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/7163PXAQ1RL._SX300_.gif,69.99,,Electronics,Computers & Accessories,Laptop & Netbook Computer Accessories,Batteries,,

Jensen JM10 Headphone with Swivel Cups and V.C.,"Jensen's JM10 stereo headphones provide convenience, durability, and comfort at an affordable price--but, like most portable equipment, they lack excellence in sound quality.Using large, 40mm elements (speaker drivers); a strong and flexible rubber headband; and stylish, pivoting earcups, the lightweight JM10s will fit just about any head and rest easily against your ears. The compact design lets you stash them in a pocket or briefcase without risk of breakage. A single wire from the left earcup alleviates wire-knotting, a common flaw in designs where each earphone is separately wired. A clippable level-control mechanism (up, down, or off) frees you from needing immediate access to your listening device, letting you tuck your portable cassette, MiniDisc, CD, or MP3 player into a backpack, purse, or pocket. An included 1/4-inch adapter fosters listening from component audio sources such as integrated amplifiers, CD players, and some DVD machines.We found the sound of the JM10s to be mellow and unfatiguing, though these characteristics result in part from a limited frequency range and a pronounced boost in the upper-bass region. If you're tired of tiny, tinny headphones, and are seeking an easy, go-anywhere headset that won't disintegrate midway through your next plane flight, the JM10s will serve you just fine.Pros:LightweightDurable and flexible headbandWell-designed volume controlCons:Muddy sound",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71YCTRZH6WL._SY300_.gif,,,Electronics,Accessories & Supplies,Audio & Video Accessories,Headphones,,

Magellan GPS Blazer12 Waterproof Hiking GPS,"Whether hiking through the woods or traveling back roads, you always know where you are with the Magellan GPS Blazer 12 Satellite Navigator. It displays bearing, heading, distance, speed, and more on its three navigation screens. Nine coordinate and thirteen map datum systems allow you to plot your position on almost any map.Setting up the Blazer 12 was easy. We just installed the batteries and initialized the receiver by answering a few on-screen questions about our location and the time and date. The unit assumes that you already know a little about basic map reading, longitude, and latitude, but the User Manual introduces you to the Blazer 12's features in no time.It took a little over three minutes for the Blazer 12 to get a position fix after initializing. After that, marking our initial position was as easy as pressing the Mark button. We watched our precise longitude and latitude change as we walked and drove; the Blazer 12 tracked our distance as we moved. As we returned to our initial position, the Blazer 12 guided us back with the appropriate directions.The Blazer 12 is rated to last 20 hours on two alkaline batteries; ours lasted eight hours on two Ni-Cad batteries. The unit is also rated to retain its memory for 30 minutes without the batteries; we checked ours at one hour and the memory was still intact.Considering the low-cost peace of mind that the Blazer 12 provides, it's hard to imagine trekking into the unknown without one.ProsInexpensiveRugged, waterproof constructionEasy-to-follow instructionsConsNo I/O or PC supportNo built-in atlas",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/614X5JJP47L._SY300_.gif,116.99,,Electronics,GPS & Navigation,Sports & Handheld GPS,Handheld GPS Units,,
Maxell Noise-Cancellation Headphones (190400),"Maxell's HP-NC1 portable headphones are equipped with Noisebuster, a patented noise-reduction technology that really works, making the HP-NC1 an ideal companion for in-flight (or even on-bus) music lovers.The Noisebuster technology works via the following process: tiny microphones within each earpiece ""listen"" for any pervasive environmental noise and send this information to a device called an in-line audio-enhancer pack. This device reads and analyzes the information and then generates a noise-cancellation wave that's out of phase with the noise itself. The audio-enhancer pack feeds this wave back into the headset--when the noise wave goes up, a corresponding cancellation wave goes down, causing the two signals to cancel each other out. This eliminates a good deal of unwanted sonic junk, from airplane engine noise to distant freeway traffic seeping into your living room.We evaluated our HP-NC1s as a utility crew used jackhammers on the street outside our listening room. Because you can bypass the Noisebuster technology with a switch, it was easy for us to compare the noise-canceled signal to the standard sound. While Noisebuster didn't entirely eliminate the jackhammer's rat-a-tat-tat, it did significantly reduce the sound so that we could listen to quiet music, such as soft jazz and classical.As for the sound of the headphones themselves, the midrange is clear, but the HP-NC1s are a little sluggish overall, with no deep bass or extended high frequencies. In fairness to the HP-NC1s, noise-canceling headsets often sound restricted in the frequency extremes, as it can be tricky for the noise-canceling devices to differentiate between noise and music. The fit of these headphones is also a little snug for our taste, but you can loosen them a bit by gently bending the headset.We have heard comparably priced, non-noise-canceling headphones that sound better than Maxell's HP-NC1. However, better sound doesn't matter much if you're having a hard time hearing the music in a noisy environment. At this price, these headphones are a bargain.Pros:Noisebuster technology works wellIn-flight dual-jack adapter includedIn-line volume controlCons:Snug fit may be uncomfortableAverage sound quality",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31KB75oGBVL._SX300_.jpg,31.31,Maxell,Electronics,Accessories & Supplies,Audio & Video Accessories,Headphones,,

Cobra ESD-6700 6 Band Radar Detector with Voice Alert,"Cobra's ESD-6700 radar/laser detector performs exceptionally well for a midpriced unit, especially in filtering out false signals. It offers both city and highway modes; however, unlike most units, the ESD-6700 actually reports weak signals when it encounters them in city mode, but doesn't sound an audio alert until the signal gets above a preset threshold.We found the ESD-6700 easy to set up. Without even opening the instruction manual, we were able to unpack and install the unit within a few minutes. The windshield mount easily slides into the rear of the unit, and you can adjust the angle to fit within your car. You control operation by a rotary on-off/volume dial and three ergonomic, top-mounted buttons that control muting, dimming, and switching for city/highway modes. For convenience, the unit also remembers its settings even when power is off.In this radar detector's audio-only mode, the alert tone depends on the radar band that the ESD-6700 receives. The display states which band the unit is picking up and reports the signal strength. Further simplifying usage, the audio pulse increases in frequency as the signal strength increases, supplying an almost-constant tone for the strongest signal. The ESD-6700 also includes a voice alert, which is handy as it states exactly what type of signal is being received: X, K, Ka, Laser, VG-2, or--in the case of a Safety Alert--the voice announces the type of alert. The ESD-6700 then provides audio tones after the initial voice alert.Most radar detectors have a few LEDs to identify the type of signal and a few LEDs to indicate signal strength. The ESD-6700 uses a large dot-matrix display that quickly identifies the type of signal and uses a large, five-segment meter to show the signal's strength. This makes it far easier to interpret, especially if you've disabled the voice alert. In the case of a safety alert, the display reads out the type of alert (such as train or emergency vehicle).The ESD-6700 has two different muting modes: automatic mute and manual mute. In automatic-mute mode, the alert tones cease three seconds after the initial alert.

KLH 9000B Home Theater Speaker System (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"Don't let the high costs of extravagant home-theater systems keep you from experiencing the thrill of a dynamic film right in your living room. With the KLH 9000B Home-Theater Speaker System, any Dolby Pro Logic- or Dolby Digital/DTS-equipped surround amp can fill a room with sound from six  separate loudspeakers.The compact system is made up of four identical two-way speakers that serve as left and right front speakers and surround satellites; a three-way, horizontally configured center-channel speaker (shielded so you can lay it atop your TV); and a ported, passive subwoofer.The 9000B is a perfect introduction to the world of home theater. It doesn't pretend to be a high-end system, but the speakers blend well for a clear, balanced sound that we found particularly impressive with multichannel  music software. Setup was easy and intuitive using the provided diagram and speaker wire. You won't need a subwoofer output on your amplifier or receiver, as the subwoofer gets wired in line with the front-channel speakers.The subwoofer, in fact, brought impressive heft to the sound, given its small size and passive design. Movie playback sounded reasonably full-bodied despite the fact that five of the six speakers are quite small. The low end didn't have the definition of larger and pricier bookshelf speakers but for rounding out the sonic picture it did just fine.The system as a whole fared well and, in fact, sounded its best during louder passages. The subwoofer comes fitted with a self-resetting circuit breaker to prevent it from damage when you play music at loud volumes.Pros:Simple setupCohesive soundPlays well at loud volumeCons:Slightly muted high frequenciesMuddy bass",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71A9XHW8X7L._SX300_.gif,149.95,,Electronics,Home Audio,Stereo Components,Speakers,Speaker Systems,

Advent AW870 Wireless Powered Speakers (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"Are there places in your home where you'd love to enjoy music, but don't want to lay speaker wire or drill holes to get it there? Advent's wireless powered speaker system lets you import music from CD, radio, DVD, or any audio source to nearly any room in the house.Advent's AW870 speaker system uses the FM (frequency-modulation) technique employed in radio to broadcast audio to the two loudspeakers, each of which houses its own 15-watt amplifier. The speakers, which are identical, offer a roll-on power/volume switch and a separate switch for designating either speaker as left, right, or mono--highly desirable when playing with different positions. (If you're listening to monaural material--including anything recorded prior to about 1954--the Mono switch will allow you to cut down on transmission static without compromising music delivery.)The AW870 system comes with two main parts: the transmitter and the speakers, all of which require close proximity to an AC outlet unless you opt to battery-power the speakers. The transmitter, about five inches in diameter, plugs into a wall outlet and hooks into your desired audio source via a single stereo RCA cable.We positioned the transmitter's tuner arbitrarily while setting up and were pleased to find that the speakers' tuner zeroed in on the appropriate frequency with little adjustment. In fact, the thing that gave us the most trouble was the fact that the speakers use individual volume controls. With no master ""balance"" knob, the two speakers have to be manually adjusted for equal volume.The transmitter range seemed surprisingly large, though static and crackle increased as we got farther away from the transmitter. Listening from across a room worked best, though the omnidirectional transmitter works through walls and floors as well. Powered with batteries (eight ""C"" cell, not provided), the AW870 speakers make ideal portable deck speakers when you don't feel like moving your whole stereo just to enjoy the nice weather.The sound from our test CDs closely resembled that of clear FM radio: dynamically compressed and slightly hissy even at its quietest. As speakers go, these are decent but not great. As with any sound system, a boost in convenience often requires a small sacrifice in quality, and this is true of the AW870 wireless system.Pros:Intuitive setupFlexible placementBattery-power optionCons:Separate volume control for each speakerNo tone controls (bass or treble)",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71FJ0EPC0KL._SX300_.gif,,,Electronics,Home Audio,Stereo Components,Speakers,Speaker Systems,

GPX C3860 Portable CD Player with 22-Track Program Mode,"An impressively low price, and easy-to-reach controls, make this portable CD player a good buy for bargain hunters. You will even find some of the advanced playing options you'd expect in more expensive units. The GPX C3860 lets you program a playlist, shuffle, and repeat tracks. A bass boost option gives a nice extra push to the sound, but overall, sound reproduction  isn't as rich as you'd hear on a higher-end player--a minor quibble considering the unit's affordability. The GPX C3860 is a nice looking unit, with a plastic, matte-gray, metallic-looking front. The primary buttons--skip (back), search (forward), set, program mode, stop, play/pause, and open--are all located on the front, and are easy to find and press. The CD door doesn't go up very far, which makes it slightly difficult to remove and insert discs. The LCD, located between the set and program mode features, shows you track, minutes, and seconds. By pressing the program mode button, you cycle through the following options: repeat track, repeat all, intro scan, random, and program. As you cycle, each option appears on the LCD and you simply press ""set"" to activate the one you want. You need to select your option within the first seconds of playing the CD, or else it doesn't go into effect, something which we found a bit confusing at first. For the program option, you forward or back up to the track you want, press set, and continue this procedure until you've completed programming. We found the programming process somewhat confusing on this unit, thanks in part to the fact that the indicators on the LCD were not easy to understand.On the left side of the unit are the headphone jack, line-out jack, and volume control. In the front are the bass and hold switches. The latter is a useful option that lets you deactivate all other features when you don't want an accidental mode change--for example, a change to a carefully programmed disc.The headphones are a bit on the light side, although this will please some people. Buffering is adequate; jarring the unit sharply made it stop for a couple of seconds, though it did resume where it left off. The unit is normally powered by two AA batteries, and a battery-saving feature shuts the power off several seconds after a CD stops playing. The GPX C3860 also has an AC jack.Pros:Large, accessible buttonsVery affordable priceCons:Somewhat difficult to program",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71MKY10RPVL._SX300_.gif,,,Electronics,Portable Audio & Video,Portable CD Players,,,

Acoustic Research HT181 Optical Digital Cable (6'),"The HT181 Toslink optical cable from Acoustic Research employs high-grade parts and sensible design principles to make it not only a tough, durable product, but also a strong link in your audio signal chain. Chief design features include gold-plated lens collars and lenses fashioned for optimal light convergence and signal transfer.This cable is an excellent conveyor of digital data between components such as minidisc players, CD players, surround receivers, laserdisc players, and DVD-Video players--just make sure your respective components have the requisite Toslink optical outputs and inputs. The HT181's 6-foot length fosters easy placement between hard-to-reach components, while its heavy-duty build ensures good signal transmission with little sonic degradation.In comparing this cable with a cheaper and thinner optical cable, we heard substantially better sound when using the HT181: high frequencies were smoother and more present, while bass tones sounded fuller and the music overall seemed more dynamic. Digital audio, being digital, ought to sound the same regardless of how it's transmitted, but the truth is that cable quality matters.

The antenna swings down to facilitate portability, and covered microphone and speaker jacks on the top of the unit make the device compatible with many popular headsets currently on the market.The voice-scrambling feature functions only when all of the people in your party are using microTALK 2 radios. If they are, then you can select a channel and subcode so that only radios with the proper configuration will be able to decipher your scrambled signal. The FRS 250 can also transmit call tones to other people who are using your channel to alert them that your transmission is about to come through.An LCD on the front of the unit displays the channel, subcode, battery indicator, and other useful information. An interesting feature of this radio is a button that disables automatic squelch settings and, thus, potentially extends the device's maximum range. This could be especially useful in an emergency, when automatic squelch would otherwise keep a distant transmission from coming through.--T.

Olympus iZoom 75 Ultra Compact APS Camera,"THE OLYMPUS I ZOOM 75. The Next Generation In Advanced Photo System Design As the first model in this new camera series, the i Zoom 75 is a culmination of advanced technologies in performance and design and represents a new dynamic in cameras. Combining film handling ease with quality optics and sophisticated, ultra-compact, all weather design, the i Zoom 75 is truly advanced. High-performance 28-75 mm Zoom Lens A 28-75 mm 2.7 zoom lens (equivalent to the 35-94 mm coverage of a 35 mm camera)with two new aspherical lens elements not only ensure high resolution, but also contribute to the reduced size and weight of the lens. The new slim-line lens barrier and ruby-gold finish highlight the elegant contours that create a stylish, futuristic look. With a high priority placed on design and ergonomics, it is only natural that the I zoom 75 measures 4.2 (W) x 2.1 (H) x 1.3 (D) inches and weighs only 5.8 ounces (without battery). The flash system has several sensors that collect information about the required illumination. It not only triggers the flash automatically in dim light or backlighting, but also adjusts the intensity for situations such as macro shooting setting that often leads to overexposure. There are also six versatile flash modes that make it easy for anyone to take great flash photographs. - Auto, Red-Eye Reduction, Flash Off, Fill-in, Night Scene, Red-Eye Reducing Night Scene Three frame formats C (Classic) for standard print, H (HDTV) for a print with the same ration as a wide-screen televisions or P(Panorama) for panorama prints. A magnetic head automatically records shooting data that includes the date/time, frame format, subject brightness and other information in the film's magnetic tracks.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71Q58BW5HSL._SX300_.gif,,,Electronics,Camera & Photo,Film Photography,Film Cameras,APS Cameras,

Just load it up with your six favorite discs--be they DV, CD, or CD-Video--and you have whole day's worth of audio-video entertainment. As an added convenience, you can switch discs without interrupting the current playing selection.The 10-bit digital-to-analog system--four times more effective than conventional methods--transforms 8-bit data to 10 bits, thus preventing critical signal loss and ensuring superb reproduction and fidelity of highly detailed images.

Toshiba CZ27V51 27&quot; TV,"The Toshiba CZ27V51 color TV proves that you don't always have to skimp on the extras to get a great quality set at a reasonable price. This 27-inch direct-view TV offers superb video performance and stereo sound as well as some cutting-edge extras.Toshiba has souped up this TV set with some impressive technology, including advanced picture-in-picture and still-frame functions. In particular, we liked the wide variety of viewing options available in the picture-in-picture mode. This unit allows you to adjust the size of the second picture window to display a program at either one-ninth or one-sixteenth of the main television screen. You can also switch the location of the picture-in-picture window to any of the four corners of the main screen.We were perplexed, however, by the frivolous still-frame feature, which allows you to freeze the picture on your TV screen at any time with a simple click of the ""still"" button on your remote control. This feature is useful for capturing on-screen text and information (such as a Web-site address or phone number), but most people probably won't use it.In addition to these fancy features, Toshiba delivers superior video and audio quality through standard AV cables. It also supports the higher-quality S-Video format, which delivers a crisper picture than a standard AV connection. If you combine this TV with a high-end Toshiba VCR or DVD player, you may be able to take advantage of a significant video-performance boost via Toshiba's proprietary ColorStream technology. The manufacturer claims that ColorStream delivers the best possible picture.Overall, we found the Toshiba CZ27V51 to be a good value. With both high-quality performance and expanded features, this model outshines most other TV models in the same price range.Pros:Top-of-the-line video qualityAdvanced picture-in-picture featuresFreeze-picture optionCons:Access to advanced ColorStream technology requires other Toshiba components",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/419F6RKK6YL._SX300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Television & Video,Televisions,LCD TVs,,

Olympus Stylus Epic Zoom 80 DLX 35mm Camera,"The Olympus Stylus Epic Zoom 80 offers advanced features and a zoom in a compact package, allowing you to get the close-up shots you want with the portability you need.While the Olympus Stylus Epic Zoom 80 is one of the smallest zoom cameras available, it is heavy on styling and great features. Its miniature version of Olympus's signature clamshell sliding case makes it easy to turn the camera on and off, while offering protection against lens scratches. It comes in a good-looking and durable brushed stainless steel case that is splash-proof, so you can shoot pictures in all kinds of weather. The 35 to 80mm zoom lens is perfect for framing portraits, getting in on the action, and capturing faraway subjects.The Olympus Stylus Epic Zoom 80 offers the advanced features of Olympus's larger camera lines, including quartz date and time imprinting, a self timer, and a handy panorama switch. The panorama switch lets you take panoramic photos on a roll of regular film. (You can take an entire panoramic roll as well.) The Olympus Stylus Epic also has a whopping six flash modes, including automatic, red-eye reduction, and night scene. It also has a useful Infinity mode, which sets the focus to let you take shots of distant landscapes and other subjects.The Olympus Stylus Epic is a pleasure to use--it is as small or smaller than many of the new Advanced Photo System (APS) cameras, but still uses standard 35mm film.Its tapered design made it easy to slip in a pocket, and since it is little larger than a deck of cards, we found ourselves carrying it everywhere. It's especially nice to have the zoom in such a compact camera.Pros:Extremely lightweight and compactDurable constructionWide range of flash optionsPanorama switchIncludes zoomCons:Battery compartment is hard to open",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71SGQ5DKHML._SX300_.gif,13.59,,Electronics,Camera & Photo,Film Photography,Film Cameras,Point & Shoot Film Cameras,

Toshiba SD-2109 DVD Player,"Toshiba has pared an excellent DVD player down to its essentials for high-quality sound and image playback, making the SD-2109 a no-frills alternative to higher-priced models. With Dolby Digital and DTS digital-audio outputs, as well as composite, S-Video, and ColorStream component video outputs, we found the SD-2109 well-equipped to power any burgeoning home-theater system.While more flexible DVD machines offer features such as analog decoding from Dolby Digital sources, karaoke-microphone inputs, and headphone jacks, the SD-2109 is by no means bereft of features. Besides traditional DVD features such as camera-angle selection, subtitling, and language preference, the Toshiba SD-2109 also offers three levels of zoom and reverse, and forward-play speeds from 1/8x to 30x. The Toshiba SD-2109 also does a great job locating specific sections on a disk through title and chapter skip as well as a convenient ""time search"" feature.A nice touch available on this and other Toshiba DVD players is Video Black Level expander circuitry. With this function you can expand the picture's overall contrast range to derive richer,  deeper blacks and finer tonal gradation, both of which we found enhanced low-light viewing. As expected, the SD-2109 proved extremely easy to set up and  navigate, tiny remote and all.

Intel ICS2USB Create-and-Share Tethered Camera,"Probably one of the easiest PC video cameras to install, the Create and Share Camera Pack will have you creating digital videos, conferencing with friends and family, and sending still images through e-mail in no time. Don't worry if you're technology-shy, this camera is made so that even the most extreme technophobe can figure it out.To set up the Create and Share Camera Pack, we just plugged our camera into the USB port on the back of our computer, turned it on, loaded the software and the install took care of the rest. The manual was incredibly easy to follow, with large print, nice illustrations, and well-divided sections for quick reference. After the software is installed, you can choose to take a tour of it or explore on your own. We found that the software was intuitive enough to just jump right in.The camera is so small and light, that if you don't permanently mount it in place, it will move around. However, once you secure the camera, it is easy to adjust with both pan and tilt. You can adjust variable lighting settings and a manual focus if the picture isn't quite right. The video looks sharp and surprisingly clear and stays in focus from various distances. Make sure you have at least 28.8 Kbps modem, so that you receive clear, unchoppy video--anything slower won't be worth your time.Aside from videoconferencing, Intel provides a number of other applications for the camera. You can send e-mail postcards, play camera games that let you interact live with the game on the screen, create and edit your own movies, or build your own Web page. One of the perks that sets Intel's package apart from the rest is the Create and Share's additional software that you can send to a friend or family member with whom you want to videoconference. Even if they don't have a camera themselves, it will enable them to see and hear you. For the novice videoconferencer, this package is a great deal, with just enough user-friendly software to make it a worthwhile investment.Pros:Nice, clear videoA great sampling of user-friendly softwareAdjustable cameraEasy to install",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71W18QNGMFL._SX300_.gif,35,Intel,Electronics,Computers & Accessories,Webcams,,,

Panasonic SC-AK47 CD Compact Stereo System (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"Panasonic's SC-AK47 music system raises the stakes for quality two-channel playback. This system is not trying to ride the growing surround-sound trend; rather, it delivers open, effortless playback from CD, cassette, and radio through two well-engineered and well-amplified loudspeakers. (The system does sport outputs for two additional speakers, but it doesn't process Dolby Pro Logic surround sound.)Panasonic not only grasps good engineering principles, but also understands that compact music systems will find themselves with many different owners in many different environments, necessitating the option of a broad array of equalization (EQ). With one user-definable and six preset EQ settings, two levels of 3-D acoustic-image EQ, and two levels of bass-pumping super woofer settings--to say nothing of the pure and direct flat (no-effects) setting--the SC-AK47 has the flexibility to adjust to anyone's taste or circumstances. But it's the fundamentals that appeal to us: tastefully balanced four-way speakers (three-way speakers superimposed over 7-inch super woofers,) backed by amazingly clear and stable 85 watts-plus per channel power.The SC-AK47 isn't perfect, of course: the bass doesn't extend much below 60 Hz, the five-CD player takes ages to switch discs, you can't change other CDs while one disc is playing, and a palm-sized remote-control does not allow adequate space for all the buttons required of a full-function remote. All the same, the fundamentals--along with the many tasteful extras-- more than compensate for these shortcomings.You get terrific sound from the dual-well cassette decks (often the first thing to go in lower-end models), good off-axis frequency response (you don't have to be right in front of the speakers for them to sound good), and the system plays very loudly before succumbing to distortion or bass compression. Other niceties include small rubber feet for each of the three pieces, removable speaker grilles, and a digital volume control that extends down to -82 dB (many cut to silence at -60 dB and above, limiting your choices in low-volume listening). In all, a wonderful little system that we highly recommend.Pros:Great CD soundFlexible equalizationWell-thought-out designAbove-average cassette soundCons:Slow disc skip/exchangeCan't change discs while one is playing",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41RTSYSCPDL._SX300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Home Audio,Compact Stereos,,,

Panasonic PV-9450 4-Head Hi-Fi VCR,"The Panasonic PV-9450 is not cluttered with features that you'll probably never use anyway, but it does offer those that are important: 4-head video quality, stereo hi-fi sound, and on-screen programming. The unit also includes Panasonic's Multi-Brand Universal Light Tower Remote, which works with most TVs and cable boxes.The PV-9450 impressed us with its simplicity; we took it out of the box, connected an antenna and TV, and plugged it in. We then followed the initial on-screen setup instructions and, by itself, the unit found the active broadcast channels and even set its clock. We played a prerecorded tape and found the picture to be crisp and sharp. The PV-9450's audio was rich and full, characteristic of hi-fi stereo.Another interesting feature of the PV-9450 is a time stamp, which, at the beginning of a videotape, displays the time and date of your recording and the channel from which it was recorded. A tape-position display shows how close you are to the beginning or end of a tape.The remote control, unlike the VCR, is a bit bulky, and its many buttons get in the way of the few you'll use most of the time. Of course, it is a universal remote, and, as such, must sacrifice some design elegance.If the most important features to you are 4-head picture quality and hi-fi stereo sound, then Panasonic PV-9450 is a sensible choice.Pros:Universal remote works with most TVs and cable boxes4 heads for a clear pictureHi-fi stereo for great soundCons:Limited feature set",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31V6AF5RHHL._SX300_.jpg,88,,Electronics,Television & Video,VCRs,,,

Need more bass? Engage the player's S-XBS circuit for slamming low end.Playback abilities include 24-track random-access programming; random play; repeat and resume (which picks up where the unit left off when last stopped); and skip/search. An auxiliary analog audio output lets you hook the player up with a stereo system using an optional stereo Y adapter (.125-inch minijack to left/right RCA), and a hold switch prevents accidental starting, stopping, or track skipping during use or transport.The player offers up to 22 hours of continuous playback with anti-skip protection off and 25 hours with anti-skip protection on using 2 AA batteries (not included). A low-battery indicator warns you when a change is due.The unit can operate on standard or rechargeable batteries and can even recharge certain batteries by itself--but be aware that the unit's battery-charging feature works only with Panasonic's P-3GAVA/2B or SH-CDB8D rechargeable batteries (no batteries included).

Sony MVC-FD71 Mavica Digital Still Camera,"The Sony MVC-FD71 Mavica digital still camera offers several user-friendly features that make picture taking fun and easy. The camera uses 3.5-inch floppy disks as its image storage media, which means you can take your pictures then remove the floppy from the camera and insert it directly into your computer without the need for any auxiliary cables or equipment. Once in the computer, you can view the pictures on your monitor; incorporate them into letters, presentations, and other documents; or e-mail the images to friends, relatives, or business associates. The universal JPEG compression format is used, making the camera compatible with Windows operating systems. This standard point-and-shoot camera also features a 10x optical zoom, a built-in flash and a 2.5-inch LCD display.What's in the BoxMVC-FD71 digital camera, NP-F330 battery pack, battery charger, power code, shoulder strap, and lens cap.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41VAY387NEL._SX300_.jpg,7.33,,Electronics,Camera & Photo,Digital Cameras,Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,,
RCA VH920 Video Source Selector (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"We were delighted with the VH920's simplicity of layout and performance. With one small box, the cable-knotting hardships of dealing with more video sources than your AV receiver can handle, are gone. If you don't have an AV receiver, don't worry--the VH920 lets you route audio and video directly into an RCA-jack-equipped television. Alternately, you can run the output of the VH920 back into an AV receiver for integration with still other audio and video sources.All of the VH920's audio inputs, as well as its single output, are stereo RCA; the video ins and out let you choose between either composite video or S-Video. A component-video (RGB) option would be nice, but if you're using equipment of that high caliber you might want to look into a higher-end routing system. If you aren't running an S-Video output to your TV, there isn't much point in using any of the S-Video inputs, unless you have sources that don't provide composite outs.The most pleasing thing about this video selector is its ability to learn different remote controls. Through a process that seems complicated in the instructions but is really quite simple, you can configure the switcher to respond to the power button of any remote control. The only hitch here is that you'll have to reprogram the switcher for your remotes if it loses power.For convenience, RCA has pre-labeled four of the inputs ""satellite,"" ""DVD,"" ""laserdisc,"" and ""VCR,"" but you're by no means restricted to using them for those items. When you're ready to give cable-swapping a rest, put down the cables and pick up a VH920.Pros:Greatly simplifies video routingEasy setupDurable constructionFeeds audio and video directly to a TVCons:Power interruption requires reprogrammingDoes not accommodate component video",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61XDRCZHTDL._SX300_.gif,17.67,,Electronics,Accessories & Supplies,Audio & Video Accessories,Distribution,Selector Switch Boxes,

KLH PSW8100-8 Down-Firing Powered Subwoofer (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"As an alternative to large, full-range speakers or as an  upgrade to an existing pair of smaller speakers, a subwoofer can  make a lot of sense. Depending on your main speakers, having or  not having a sub can mean the difference between merely watching  videos or experiencing home theater. The KLH PSW8100-8 powered  subwoofer is a solid and affordable entry-level subwoofer capable  of slamming loads of bass to every last nook and cranny of your  living room.But while the PSW8100-8 offers deep bass and heavy power, it isn't necessarily the smoothest of subwoofers. (At this price range, you can't expect it to be.) We found it a bit difficult to integrate with our system if we weren't feeding it a dedicated subwoofer output, such as the "".1""-channel information from a Dolby Digital or DTS 5.1-channel source.The phase-inversion switch--a great feature to find on a budget subwoofer--allowed the PSW8100-8 to sit farther from our speakers without sounding like it. One of the things that can happen when using multiple speakers in different locations is phase cancellation, where sound waves meet at different points in their wave cycles, nullifying each other when one's ""peak"" finds another's ""valley."" If the subwoofer sounds like it's not working, it could be because it's out of phase with the main speakers (in its current location at least). Inverting the phase by 180 degrees can sometimes bring the sounds more closely into alignment.Using direct subwoofer feeds through the two-channel RCA inputs  (the ""left"" plug serves both for mono feeds) shortened the setup  and integration process considerably, readily providing the deep,  tight bass the PSW8100-8 is capable of.Pros:Good soundEasy setupFlexible inputsCons:Tricky integration when not using dedicated low-frequency  outputs",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41014VGRAML._SY300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Home Audio,Stereo Components,Speakers,Subwoofers,

JVC XV-D701BK DVD Player,"Don't settle for VHS picture quality: With the JVC XV-D701BK DVD player, you can enjoy a breathtaking video experience and lay the cornerstone to your home-theater setup. The DVD player was easy to set up, and it came with a wide selection of video cables. The digest feature let us see up to nine opening scenes at once and choose the section of the video we wanted. We got the hang of the online menu fairly quickly, and it gave us a huge range of options. The picture was sharp--far superior to VHS--and sound was exceptionally crisp. The wide range of audio options not only let us choose between stereo and home-theater settings but also gave us an expert option for customizing settings to match our speakers.The 3D Phonic feature did a surprisingly good job of simulating surround sound on a two-channel system, although to take full advantage of Dolby Digital Surround quality, you'll need two rear speakers and a center-channel speaker in addition to your normal stereo speakers. The XV-D701BK did a phenomenal job playing audio CDs as well, providing as many on-screen CD menu options as most basic CD players. Overall, its rich feature set and high performance make the XV-D701BK a superb video and audio source for a home theater of any size.Pros:Compatible with both Dolby Digital and DTS surround soundPlays audio CDs as wellDigest feature lets you choose from opening-scene thumbnailsCons:Remote has a bit of a learning curveDoesn't include monaural audio cable for TVs without stereo",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517SM61GE6L._SX300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Television & Video,DVD Players & Recorders,DVD Players,,

Nakamichi AV3S Dolby Pro Logic Receiver (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"With the AV3S Dolby Pro Logic Receiver, Nakamichi affirms  its longstanding reputation for quality sound, bringing 70 watts of front-channel power and several winning design features to an affordable audio-video (AV) receiver. The clearly laid out AV3S is ready to use  in a heartbeat, with all features clearly indicated on both its  solid front panel and the supplied remote control (which  operates both Nakamichi CD and cassette decks).The Dolby Pro Logic-equipped AV3S pumps an impressive 70 watts per channel (wpc) to the front speakers and 55 wpc to the rear. The system  employs Nakamichi's Harmonic Time Alignment technology on each  of the four powered channels to minimize distortion. As with all Pro Logic systems, the  AV3S derives its surround program from any two-channel audio input,  which the receiver independently processes and routes to left,  center, right, and surround speakers. It wouldn't be a true AV  receiver without a subwoofer output, though, and the inclusion of  one on the AV3S nicely augments the Pro Logic surround and  standard music playback.Independent level adjustments for the center- and rear-channel outputs and a variable delay  time for the surround channels (from 15 to 30 milliseconds in 5-ms increments) help facilitate setup. But the star of this show is the sound quality. The receiver drives large speakers to ear-splitting levels with power to spare, succumbing to neither compression nor distortion. We found the sound clear and well-balanced, inviting longer listening and more volume. However, most of your listening will probably be at reasonable sound levels, and the AV3S excelled here as well. Aided by a bass- and treble-boosting ""loudness"" switch, the receiver delivered clear and full-bodied low-level sound--an under-appreciated trait of a quality amplifier.The AV3S is perfect for audio enthusiasts who have a growing interest in home theater but want an affordable, full-featured integrated receiver.Pros:Good soundHigh powerClever featuresFlexible AV routingCons:Not Dolby Digital-equipped",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71H5K8NS6HL._SX300_.gif,,,Electronics,Home Audio,Stereo Components,Receivers & Amplifiers,Component Receivers,

3Com 3CSOHO100-TX Office Connect Fast Ethernet Network Interface Card,"The 3Com OfficeConnect Fast Ethernet NIC is ideal  for small office environments looking for a reliable, easy  to install, cost-effective networking solution. Designed  for small offices and home-based businesses, the 3Com  OfficeConnect Fast Ethernet network interface card (NIC)  (3CSOHO100-TX) is ideal for Pentium-class desktop computers  with internal 32-bit PCI expansion slots. The NIC is  10/100, meaning that it can connect to either 10BaseT or  100BaseTX networks. Its auto-sensing capability allows the  NIC, when connected to a hub port, to automatically sense  and connect at the correct network speed--whether 10 or 100  Mbps. This means small offices can begin using the NIC now,  even if they don't plan to upgrade to a faster 100 Mbps  network right away. Simply connect the NIC to a hub port  via Category 5 (UTP) cable for network access. Like all  3Com NICs, the 3Com OfficeConnect Fast Ethernet NIC boasts  top-notch performance to allow small offices to share  files, exchange e-mail, and manage other LAN-based  applications quickly and efficiently. By simultaneously  performing multiple processing tasks, the OfficeConnect  Fast Ethernet NIC provides the fastest data transfer speeds  available for the PCI bus. The OfficeConnect Fast Ethernet  NIC is optimized to work in Windows environments-- specifically PCs running Windows 95, 98 or NT. The  installation software allows connection from the PC to  Microsoft and Novell NetWare networks. Not only is the NIC  powerful and reliable, it is easy to install. Like all 3Com  NICs, the OfficeConnect NIC is plug-and-play compliant with  Windows 95 and 98, and includes a Windows-based diagnostics  and configuration utility for easy installation and  troubleshooting. Link-activity and network-status LEDs  provide a convenient at-a-glance indication of network  health and status. 3Com's comprehensive documentation goes  a long way in making installation easy, especially for the  small office customer who may be new to networking. The  user guide covers topics ranging from the basics of  networking to step-by-step instructions on how to install  and use the NIC under Windows 95, 98, and NT. More  information on the benefits of networking for small offices  can be found in the Network Assistant CD-ROM that ships  with the NIC.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71YJ4N0WHVL._SX300_.gif,40.99,,Electronics,Computers & Accessories,Computer Components,Network Cards,,

Diamond SupraExpress USB (PC/Mac),"Most people never consider upgrading the modems that came with their systems. Installing a new modem is usually tricky, and the results are rarely worth the trouble, especially if you already have a 56 Kbps modem installed. But all that has changed since the introduction of USB modems. These external devices are simple to install and tend to outperform similar devices that use older interfaces. Diamond Multimedia's sleek SupraExpress USB is a small external modem that surpassed our expectations.The SupraExpress USB lacks many of the bells and whistles we're used to seeing with standard, external serial-port modems. It weighs only a few ounces and has only four lights on the face of its USB modem: one shows the modem is on, one tells if the phone line is currently in use, and the remaining two blink if the modem is either receiving or sending data. It's a simple layout that's useful and easier to decipher than the external modem codes of the past.As stated, setting up the modem is a snap. Just connect a standard phone line to a wall jack, snap the other end into either of the two ports on the back of the modem, and attach the included USB cable to your PC or Mac. You then can connect a telephone to the other jack on the back of the modem if you need one. Many other external modems require you to attach a telephone to them before they'll work. You might be surprised when you see there is no power cord. Like many USB products the SupraExpress doesn't need one, as it draws power directly from the PC through the USB cable.Our computer was running when we attached the modem, and Windows 98 immediately recognized the hardware. The SupraExpress USB replaced an older 56 Kbps ISA modem, and the results were stunning. Average data transfer rates more than quadruple those of the old modem. With the old modem, we were unable to join many online games because it produced high latency, but lag was slashed with the SupraExpress USB. We were able to enjoy every online game we tried.If you're buying this product based on specifications listed on the box, be aware that some of them are incorrect. This modem does not support distinctive ring when used with Windows and it doesn't support either caller ID or distinctive ring when attached to a Mac.If your current 56 Kbps modem crawls around the Web, takes an eternity to download files, and frequently loses its connection (as our previous modem did), the SupraExpress USB may alleviate those problems. We highly recommend it to anyone with a USB-enabled computer.--T.

Labtec LCS2414REGN Audio F/X Series Speaker,"While Labtec's LCS-2414 three-speaker set doesn't provide the surround sound benefit of its nearly identical (but with two more satellites) LCS-2514, it does cost $30 less. For only $50, the LCS-2414 speakers deliver excellent sound with booming bass at a price right for first-time speaker buyers.Setup is a breeze with this set. Plug the color-coded cables from the right speaker into the left, the sub, your PC's sound card, and a power outlet, and you're ready to go. With 9 feet of cable for each satellite, you can position the speakers almost anywhere. Although tiny, these little cubes of sound deliver a lot of audio oomph (5 watts per satellite channel).The 15-watt wood-enclosed subwoofer is more impressive than it looks. Although the bass level isn't separately adjustable, it pumps out appropriately according to the volume output you've set on the right speaker. Both the satellites and the woofer benefit from Labtec's Max-X drivers, which boosts bass and limits sound distortion at high volume levels. Even with the speakers turned all the way up, distortion was negligible.The size of the satellites makes them especially appealing to users with limited desk space. At roughly 3 inches square, they'll fit anywhere you can squeeze a spot open and deliver sound that belies their size. The set only offers basic controls (with the power button awkwardly located on the subwoofer and the volume control on the right satellite)--no treble or bass adjustments and no headphone jack. And unlike many two- and three-speaker sets, the LCS-2414 doesn't offer any kind of 3-D sound effects. But if that's your bag, you're better off spending the extra $30 and getting the true surround sound of the LCS-2514.You can find three-speaker sets for less than these Labtecs, but you'll be hard-pressed to find a set that sounds as good as these for the money.--J. CurtisPros:Great soundEasy to set upGood priceCons:No 3-D sound effectsNo bass or treble controlsNo headphone jack",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31B70D9K2GL._SX300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Computers & Accessories,Cables & Accessories,Computer Speakers,,
Uniden BC895XLT 300-Channel TrunkTracker Scanner (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"The Uniden Bearcat TrunkTracker BC 895XLT is a scanner for the serious radio enthusiast. The BC 895XLT is packed with an impressive array of features, such as trunk tracking, delay, lockout, search and scan, Continuous Tone Control Squelch System (CTCSS), one-touch weather scan, and severe weather alert. In addition, this scanner has a strong frequency range of 29 MHz to 965 MHz.Setting up the BC 895XLT was simple--we attached the antenna, plugged in the AC adapter, and turned on the unit. With so many function buttons on the face of the unit, using the BC 895XLT may seem daunting without consulting the manual. However, the manual is incredibly user friendly, with definitions of all functions, pictures, and step-by-step instructions for performing certain applications. It also includes a foldout diagram of the face of the unit with descriptions of each button so you can easily reference while skimming the manual.With 300 channels, the BC 895XLT provides more programmable channels than most scanners.  Organized into 10 bank keys that hold 30 programmed frequencies each, the scanner can also be preprogrammed with 10 priority channels. We had no problem performing basic operations and programming active frequencies into selected channels and banks. Features such as scanning, channel lockout, weather alert, and searching were relatively easy to figure out using the operating guide. More advanced features such as CTCSS operation and trunk tracking, while more complicated, were also accessible.One nice touch is the squelch control, which raises or lowers the ""Squelch Gate"" so that you can control what kind of signals get in and eliminate the constant hiss that accompanies weak signals. We also appreciated the adjustable LCD backlight, which makes the display easy to read in almost any condition, and the desktop stand, which allows you to see and use the scanner at a more viewable angle. The auxiliary jack lets you connect an external recorder so that you can automatically record any activity on a specified channel. There is also an external speaker jack that can be used to connect headphones for private listening.The unit ships with a Betty Bearcat Starter Frequency Guide that lists some statewide and city frequencies used by police and fire departments, weather services, forest rangers, as well as ham radio operators and miscellaneous frequency assignments. You can also order the Betty Bearcat Regional and National Police Directories or Mr. Scanner's Local Frequency List for more in-depth listings including rescue squad, local government, forestry radio, marine radio, aircraft, amateur radio, and federal government frequencies.If you're interested only in simple radio scanning and tracking, then take a look at a lower-end model. But if you're an expert radio operator looking for a super-powerful tracking device, you'll be thrilled with the BC 895XLT. The folks at Uniden thought of everything when designing this one.Pros:Easy-to-understand operation guideSimple programmingTrunk tracking and CTCSS for more advanced usersEasy-to-read display",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71VWQ1Y92XL._SX300_.gif,,,Electronics,Security & Surveillance,Radio Scanners,,,

Logitech Quickcam VC USB DV Camera ( 961111-0100 ),"Remember just decades ago when video conferencing was a futuristic  vision in sci-fi movies? Well, now the future is here and you can bring it home  with the Logitech QuickCam VC. Whether you want to email photos, shoot your own  video clips, or chat with friends and family over the Internet, you can do it  with the QuickCam.Setup is simple. Take the camera out of the box, place it  on top of your computer, and plug the cord into an empty USB port. Though you  should be able to connect the USB cable to any port, the camera needs extra  energy and should be connected directly to your computer or into a hub. We  tested the QuickCam with an iMac, and though the instructions say you can plug  it right into your keyboard, we had to use a direct connection to completely  power the camera. Insert the CD into your CD-ROM drive and the software will  kick in and instruct you in the installation procedure.The QuickCam comes  loaded with all the software you'll need to get started (if you have a Mac  you'll need QuickTime, which you probably already have; if not, you can download  the newest version free directly from Apple's Web site). For video conferencing,  use Microsoft NetMeeting if you have a PC, and iVisit if you have a Mac--both  are included with the QuickCam VC. Just follow the installation instructions to  get going. Both QuickMovie and QuickPict have editing capabilities so you can  adjust your images before sending them. Also included is Microsoft Internet  Explorer and the screensaver program AfterDark as a full or regular screen  QuickSaver.The camera is a 360-degree rotating sphere on a triangular base.  It does not rotate up or down, but with the 6-foot cable you can position the  camera at any height you like, and adjusting the ring around the lens serves as  a manual focus. The QuickCam automatically adjusts to the correct light so your  pictures will come out balanced (but this does not mean you can take photos in  the dark; you do need appropriate light in the room). The pictures are  incredibly clear, and like most digital cameras, have a slight lag time while  recording.Made of black plastic with a long elastic cord, the QuickCam is  durable and long-lasting. Remove the camera from its base and suddenly you have  a handheld digital camera, albeit one that's still tethered to your computer. As  with all cameras, we suggest you don't touch the lens--it's small and easily  smudged, but not so easy to clean.An innovative and ultramodern way to visit  with family and friends, you can use the QuickCam to send photos or movies to  whomever you chose in minutes. The video conferencing feature is wonderful for  both business meetings and for a more personal connection than a phone call.  It's especially great for traveling parents to keep in touch with what's  happening at home or for students away at college to stay connected.--Dana  Van NestPros:Quick install procedureClear, precise imagesGreat way to keep in touchCons:May need to download extra software",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/716W7HJXJSL._SX300_.gif,21.83,,Electronics,Computers & Accessories,Webcams,,,

Logitech TrackMan Marble FX Trackball,"If you're used to a traditional mouse, then the Logitech TrackMan Marble FX may take a little getting used to. But despite its large, clunky appearance, this mouse has it all. Designed for those with limited desktop space, the TrackMan Marble FX remains stationary. You operate it by moving a large marble with your fingers while a sensor inside the mouse interprets the movement.Solid and well built, the TrackMan Marble FX has a large, eye-catching red marble. Its weight and rubberized bottom keep it from sliding on your desk, and the curve of the mouse fits most hands (except lefties). Those with small hands may find it hard to reach the left-click mouse button, making double-clicking tricky.Installation is not as quick as most plug-and-play mouse devices, as you must install Logitech MouseWare software to fully take advantage of the TrackMan Marble FX's features. However, the manual walks you through installation, making set up easy and quick.Perhaps the nicest feature of this trackball is the four programmable buttons. During setup, you can program which buttons you want to perform certain functions. Most will want to set the far left and right buttons as on a typical PC mouse. However, the two middle buttons can be set for functions such as universal scroll, auto scroll, zoom, drag lock, or HyperJump and CyberJump--pop-up windows with shortcut functions in Windows 95 and Internet environments.If you're in the market for a trackball and have the time to learn to use a new type of mouse, then you'll want to consider the TrackMan Marble FX. Its durability and low maintenance make it superior and easy to use.Pros:Sturdy and well constructedProgrammable buttonsDirt resistantCons:Difficult for those with small handsNot designed for leftiesRequires software installation",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/313CDNQ2TNL._SX300_.jpg,34.44,,Electronics,Computers & Accessories,Cables & Accessories,Input Devices,Trackballs,

To set this up, you need to connect the scanner to your PC using the included adapter and connect to the SmartScan database. However, because you are connecting to a 1-900 number, there is a 99-cent-per-minute charge for this service--so be careful how much time you spend downloading frequencies.You can also track multiple trunked and conventional channels at the same time, scan trunked frequencies, and apply a five-second trunk delay so you can hear both sides of the conversation when the trunked frequencies change.--L.E.

Logitech QuickCam Pro PC Video Camera for Parallel Port,"Why settle for text when you can express yourself in living color? Send video e-mail, participate in video conferences, take pictures, and make videos with the inexpensive, easy-to-install QuickCam Pro PC video camera.The first thing we noticed when we took the QuickCam out of the box is that it is small and sturdy. Setting up the QuickCam was very easy--we just dropped in the software CD-ROM, followed the setup wizard, and then connected the QuickCam to our PC's parallel and keyboard ports. (Make sure you follow the directions in order.) We restarted the computer, clicked the QuickCam icon, and there we were, on screen, in beautiful 24-bit color.In our test, we created still shots and digital home videos. The camera adjusted itself surprisingly accurately and quickly for a variety of conditions. It focused down to just a few inches and compensated for lighting changes, from dim indoor shadows to sunlight through a window.We used the QuickCam software to organize our still shots and videos and to prepare them for e-mail transfer. The software took an AVI video clip lasting 105 seconds (80.7 MB), converted it to RealMedia (RM) format, and inserted it into an e-mail message as an attachment occupying only 1.89 MB. The conversion process took about 90 seconds, and although it introduced some expected graininess and compression artifacts, we were still very impressed with the resulting quality.We ran Microsoft NetMeeting, which allows you to participate in video conferences, and it correctly identified the QuickCam as the installed camera. To set up the conferencing feature, you'll need to review Microsoft NetMeeting's documentation.With its straightforward setup, intuitive software, stylish design, and low price, the QuickCam is both functional and lots of fun.--Mike BrownPros:Easy to set upPC and Mac compatibleGreat value, low priceCons:None",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41EYTQCQA0L._SX300_.jpg,67.99,,Electronics,Computers & Accessories,Webcams,,,
JVC FS-7000 Executive MicroSystem (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"To look at the JVC FS-7000 Ultra Compact component system is to want to  play it, and to play it is, unavoidably, to love it. This system was designed  for a tiny space and it sounds so inviting at low levels that you'll keep reaching  for the volume knob.With its champagne-gold aluminum face plate and European cherrywood  speakers, the FS-7000 is an eye pleaser. But the real value lies in its  effortless 13-watts-per-channel sound, which, from the single CD or built-in  tuner, comes through clear, punchy, and surprisingly loud for speakers with 3-inch cones. On our test material, voices were rendered sweetly and naturally,   producing extended high frequencies without subjecting us to steely sibilance  or blatant peakiness. The FS-7000's CD player successfully delineated  complex instrumental passages with a little help from the Active Hyper-Bass  function, which lends the low end some much-needed presence (you'll probably  leave this on).In comparing the onboard CD player with a standalone player piped in through one of two line inputs, the sound--and in particular the soundstaging--was clearly better from the standalone. This suggests that the FS-7000's preamp/amplifier stages are of higher quality than the onboard CD player.While the JVC FS-7000's most endearing feature is its good sound, convenience also ranks highly. Besides fitting nicely on a 15-inch stretch of shelf space, the system offers tone controls, a line-level input and output (to accommodate a MiniDisc recorder or tape deck), and a dedicated subwoofer output for those who want real heft in the playback. All of these features are reigned in through a proportionately large, vertical-stance, full-function remote control.A handy clock/timer with 20-minute back-up power and snooze function enables the FS-7000 to provide a musical wake-up call, while a dual-layer (orange and blue) FL display shows a digital representation of an analog clock when the unit is off.Though some assembly is required (namely connecting the speakers with the neatly soldered speaker wire, which is provided), the FS-7000 was a breeze to operate and program and should pose little threat to the technologically wary.Pros:Great sound in a small packageInput/output jacksAttractive appearancePlays loud without distortionCons:Hums and buzzes due to unclean or overtaxed AC power  conditionsAudible compression with bass-heavy materialNo balance control",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/7148TQBSQML._SX300_.gif,198,,Electronics,Home Audio,Compact Stereos,,,

We laid out each component of the kit and dived right into networking our Windows 98 and Windows NT 4.0 PCs. Setup was surprisingly simple using the explicit instructions and illustrations. Most helpful was the supplied diagram of the finished network in the user's guide.We connected the hub to the power supply to ensure it was working, removed the covers of our computers, installed the network interface cards (NICs) in free PCI slots in each machine, and connected them to the hub with the provided cables. The cables themselves are 25 feet long, giving you more than enough distance between each computer in most cases. The NIC comes 100-Mbps ready, so you can upgrade to a 100-Mbps hub at a later time if necessary.After ensuring that all connections were secure, we started our machines and installed the network drivers. Installation went flawlessly. We networked our two computers to one common multifunction device, set up shared files, and a shared network connection.The Netgear SB-104 Network Ethernet Starter Kit is a great choice if you're looking for a simple way to network two PCs but want a convenient growth path in case your needs expand.

Harman Kardon DC520 Dual Cassette Deck (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"A cassette deck may not top your current list of hot components to try out, but this HK dual-well deck is a sizzler. We loved the DC520's design, operation, sound, and looks--nothing gets in the way of recording and enjoying good music here.Setup and the realization of the deck's many functions were both instantaneous--a quick review of the DC520's attractive front panel is all you need (there's no remote, after all). The two-color display shows deck status, record mode, tape direction, and tape counters. A small balance knob governs a large input-level adjuster, a two-position switch manages the auto-reverse feature, and a Dolby NR (noise reduction) setting lets you select Dolby B, C, or ""off.""Other functions include high-speed dubbing, record mute (which inserts a four-second pause during recording), and a sexy feature called Sync Reverse, which uses auto-reverse to intelligently manage tape copying with tapes of unequal length. If the playback tape is longer, the tape being recorded will end up missing the ends of each side. If the record tape is longer, the DC520 will wait until the record tape winds to the end of its first side before starting in on the second side of the playback cassette.The DC520's most salient feature has to be its sound, and at a time when CD and minidisc are coupling to inch the poor old cassette off the playing field, that's saying a lot! The fact is, though, we all have boxes of old tapes lying around that we just can't bear to part with, and the DC520 made it fun to dig them out and give 'em another pull across the tape heads. Tapes that were 15 years old--rife with dropouts and fading signals--came to life again in the wells of this deck. The DC520 brings a stability and warble-freeconfidenceto the playback that other cassette decks (to say nothing of boomboxes) can't seem to muster.The recordings we made sounded clean and punchy, much like their digital sources. Dolby HX Pro reportedly allows the deck to accurately record distortion-free treble frequencies at high input levels. Owing it to HX Pro or not, the DC520 performed very well under duress; distortion was not apparent even when levels were pushing the +6 dB maximum on the meter.In recording, the pause button works great, letting you pause and resume on a dime for quick transitions on mixed tapes. But while the pause button makes perfectly silent transitions,stoppinga recording leaves a sizeable click on the tape. So if it's between hitting Stop and letting the tape run to its end, choose the latter. (There is no click when pressing Record.)Noise reduction was hit and miss. Dolby C effectively reduces tape hiss, but the sound quality is not as pleasing as it is with Dolby B or, best of all, Dolby off. If you're taping busy music like pop, rock, or much jazz, don't bother with the Dolby--you'll never notice the tape hiss. Dolby C comes in handy, however, with classical music or other dynamic material, keeping quiet notes from being buried under tape hiss.Scant few component cassette decks include volume controls for their headphone jacks, and the DC520 follows the herd here--as if tapes were inherently recorded at the level at which you want to listen to them!Quibbles aside, the DC520 is a remarkable cassette deck, offering optimal recording and playback of a convenient little format that refuses to die.--Michael MikesellPros:Simple setup and operationGreat soundResponsive, full-logic controlsForgiving record levelsDurable constructionCons:No remote controlRecords a click when you hit StopNo volume control for headphone jack",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61AH24Z9Y1L._SX300_.gif,,,Electronics,Home Audio,Stereo Components,Tape Decks,,

Jensen JMP50 2-Piece Computer Speakers,"The Jensen Convergence Series JMP-50s are a great bargain if you're looking for  an inexpensive pair of speakers to hook up to a PC.Setup of the JMP-50s is easy and doesn't require the included documentation. Simply plug the right speaker into the speaker jack or sound card on your computer--Mac or PC--and then plug the left speaker into the right speaker. The wires are permanently attached to each speaker so there is no chance of confusing where each wire connects. The power cord is also permanently attached, and because the speakers have a built-in AC-to-DC converter, the plug does not have a bulky external converter. This makes it easier to find a place to plug the JMP-50s in--no need to move things around on your power strip to make room.The cord that connects the two speakers is just over 4 feet in length, limiting how far you can space the JMP-50s from your computer. Fortunately, the speakers have ample magnetic shielding, so if you place the JMP-50s right next to your monitor, they won't cause any screen distortion.The sound of the Jensen JMP-50s is a bit hollow and lacking in bass, but that's not unusual for speakers that cost less than 20 bucks. However, these speakers do lack bass and treble controls, which can often be found in other speakers in the same price range.These speakers are perfect for your computer at work or for an extra home system for the kids.

Sony STR-DE525 Surround Receiver (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"If you're home-theater bound and ready for a surround amp, this receiver offers high power, good sound, and flexible playback options using state-of-the-art, 32-bit processing. The only real shortcoming is that it doesn't feature surround decoding for Dolby Digital or DTS. If you're using DVD, make sure your player can supply six channels of decoded, analog audio before purchasing the STR-DE525.If you're not yet using DVD, the STR-DE525 offers extensive two-channel surround-processing options, including Dolby Pro Logic and 10 other modes (divided between Music and Cinema), all courtesy of Sony's Digital Cinema Sound. Digital Cinema Sound is easily the best-sounding DSP (digital signal processing) of any we've heard. All too often these features are fun for a few minutes but largely useless long term.Setup of the receiver was simple and more or less intuitive, though getting the hang of Sony's supplied Remote Commander required a thorough read-through of the manual. This receiver's powerful remote is capable of operating not only the STR-DE525 but also all Sony TVs, VCRs, tape decks, CD players, and other components. While the Commander does allow remote operation of most STR-DE525 functions, some of them (most notably the tone controls) required manual setting via the unit's front panel.Upon listening, we were instantly impressed with the receiver's power and dynamic prowess. At 100 watts per channel in both stereo and surround playback, the STR-DE525 ranks among the most powerful surround receivers available at this price range. The receiver's discrete output transistors are said to offer high-current capacity with low distortion, and this unit delivered clean sound with deep, solid bass even without a subwoofer. The high frequencies sounded slightly ""peaky"" or over emphasized relative to our higher-priced reference amp, but this emphasis only proved glaring at high volumes. (We found that notching the treble down 2 dB with the unit's tone controls evened it out.)Playback flexibility includes the myriad surround modes, a sleep timer, a balance knob, a phono input for a turntable (a valuable but scarce feature these days), Direct Tuning for the radio (type the numbers for the station you want to hear), a sequential test tone for helping with system balance, and a bass-boost circuit for low-level listening. You can also adjust the levels and the delay time for the surround channels relative to the front channels to optimize the spaciousness of the surround effects.A convenient Sound-Field-On/Off button lets you cancel all surround effects at a moment's notice for clean, high-quality two-channel playback. This button is unnecessary if you're using the 5.1-channel analog inputs, however, as all surround processing and tone controls are disabled when listening in this mode. The thinking here is that the decoded surround channels are all appropriately processed in your DVD source material--and while that might be the case, disabling the tone controls prevents you from using them to compensate for deficiencies in your listening room when enjoying decoded Dolby Digital or DTS surround sound.Still, for an affordable, general-purpose surround receiver, the STR-DE525 offers a formidable combination of performance, features, and price.Pros:High powerGood soundFlexible surround configurationsCons:Tone controls don't work with 5.1-channel inputs",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/417YMGDBGAL._SX300_.jpg,128,,Electronics,Home Audio,Stereo Components,Receivers & Amplifiers,Component Receivers,

Infinity RS-4 Floor-Standing Speaker System (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"Well-balanced, reasonably priced floorstanding  loudspeakers are not easy to come by, but Infinity's Reference  Series RS-4 is a great example of dynamic, nearly full-range  loudspeakers that don't require a second mortgage to enjoy.On the Infinity RS-4 speakers, music ranging from rock to classical and new age  sounded equally at ease, with acoustic instruments and voices  sounding especially full-bodied and natural. We were immediately  impressed with the high sensitivity of the RS-4 speakers: At 90 dB, even small  integrated amps or receivers can drive this system toward its 112- dB limit. Even under dynamic duress, the Infinity RS4 system maintained its  ""snap"" and punchiness, never flattening out or congesting at the  loudest passages of our test material.At its loudest, the RS-4 system got a bit ""peaky"" in the high frequencies, and the highs in general sounded ""harder"" or more metallic than those from better, higher-priced speakers, but these qualities pale beside the RS-4's considerable strengths.The RS-4 imaged well and its bass extension was strong, commanding  decent--and clean--low frequencies even in smaller rooms. Used  with a powered subwoofer, the RS-4 kicked even lower, but the subwoofer  was by no means necessary. If you're looking for a well-rounded  speaker pair to upgrade your music system or start building a  home theater, the magnetically shielded Infinity RS-4 speaker system is a fine place to  start.Pros:High sensitivityGood tonal balanceStrong dynamicsEasy placementCons:High frequencies slightly ""hard""",http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-site/icons/no-img-sm._CB192198896_.gif,,,Electronics,Home Audio,Stereo Components,Speakers,Floorstanding Speakers,

This player delivers high-quality video and audio, scoring points for Sony's attention to detail.Many DVD consumers don't have a complete surround sound system, which is necessary to experience Dolby Digital 5.1 channel sound. Sony's Digital Cinema Sound System enhances the separation and sound quality of the audio for those with less-than-ideal acoustic environments. For example, the DVPS530D can play movies in an enhanced surround mode that simulates rear speakers in their absence.For those who want to take the deep-end plunge into digital sound, the unit contains a built-in Dolby Digital 5.1-channel decoder that delivers surround sound with superior dynamics and frequency response. We were impressed with the easy to understand setup controls, which helped us correctly configure our speaker placement. The resulting Dolby Digital 5.1 channel sound rocked the room.While the sound is something to shout about, it is the picture that really deserves a second look. The DVPS530D contains four-tap filters for its letterbox conversion. This achieves greater stability than two-tap filters because it reduces interline flicker and jagged edges in the picture.The unit also includes several advanced modes that let you seek out specific DVD scenes with the touch of your remote. The clean digital picture quality stays intact when you freeze the frame, advance frame-by-frame, and use slow motion and smooth scan modes. As an added bonus, the player is compatible with both music and video CDs.If you are ready to commit to DVD but don't want to empty your savings account, the Sony DVPS530D is a good bet.Pros:Good quality sound and videoBuilt-in Dolby Digital decoderSmooth picture during scanning and slow-motionCons:Does not allow slow forward and reverseLacks quick-access drive feature found in higher-price Sony models",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/117D83S15KL.jpg,33,,Electronics,Television & Video,DVD Players & Recorders,DVD Players,,
Pioneer CT-W205R Dual-Well Auto-Reverse Cassette Deck (Dolby B/C) (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"The CT-W205R offers everything you need in a 21st-century cassette deck: convenience, quality, and affordability. Convenience, because many cars have tape decks and most of us still have boatloads of perfectly good tapes lying around the house. Quality, because cassettescansound good, and CDs have heightened our sonic expectations. And affordability, because, after all, we're talking about cassettes here, and who wants to throw a lot of money in that direction?In this dual-well deck, one transport records and plays, while the other just plays--but both offer full autoreverse, even while recording. And with relay play (deck I to deck II), you'll get more than three hours of music by using two 100-minute tapes. A special rewind autoplay feature for deck I commences playback from the moment a cassette finishes rewinding, freeing you from monitoring the deck while the winding is in progress.For noise reduction, the CT-W205R is outfitted with Dolby B and C (Dolby B reduces noise by about 10 dB, while Dolby C knocks it down 20 dB), and it will play (but not record) tapes encoded with S-type noise reduction. A built-in MPX filter blocks the 19 kHz stereo-broadcast multiplex tone when you're recording off the air. This gives you more accurate Dolby noise-reduction tracking and clean recordings from FM radio.Full-logic controls offer electronic, rather than mechanical, control of the deck's transport system, giving you more reliability, smoother operation, and quicker one-touch controls. Other features include auto tape selector (normal/CrO2/metal), high-speed dubbing, auto space record mute, 15-track music search, six-LED level meters (with peak hold for setting optimal recording levels), and a .25-inch stereo headphone jack for private listening.What's in the BoxCassette deck, user's manual, and pair of stereo analog (left/right) RCA interconnects (one each for playback and record).",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41KEZGYBABL._SX300_.jpg,169.99,,Electronics,Home Audio,Stereo Components,Tape Decks,,

We found it easy to use, although we recommend reading the manual to learn how to use the preset exposure and continuous-drive modes.The Minolta Freedom Zoom Explorer reads DX-coded film from ISO 25 to 3,200, making it suitable for specialty slow and high-speed work. (Many point-and-shoots accept only a limited range of film speeds.) It offers both automatic and manual rewind options.The Minolta Freedom Zoom Explorer has a 28mm to 70mm  zoom lens for shots ranging from wide-angle to portraits or medium close-ups. The only drawback we experienced was that the zoom lens retracts in steps rather than in one continuous motion; if you need to frame a photo exactly, we recommend zooming in instead of out. Besides auto-exposure mode, the Minolta Freedom Zoom Explorer also provides macro, night-portrait, and  landscape settings for optimal exposure and focus. The built-in flash can be set to auto, red-eye reduction, fill-flash, or off.The Minolta Freedom Zoom Explorer's continuous-drive  mode lets you take pictures continuously by holding down the shutter release.

JVC RVB99BK Kaboom! Boombox,"The appearance of JVC's RV-B99 Kaboom! boombox is striking  enough that you might be tempted to dismiss it as a gimmicky showpiece. Don't. Rugged build was definitely a  priority in JVC's design, but when it comes to sound qualityandquantity, the RV-B99 is far and away the best value going in  portable music systems.The RV-B99 sounded terrific on our full range of program  material, from rock and rap to classical and acoustic world  music. The unit delivered clear, balanced sound from two 6.5-inch  woofers, two 3.25-inch drivers, and no tweeters, underscoring the  fact that simpler is often better, especially when striving for  cost-efficiency. JVC quite obviously put its money into  amplification (26 watts per high-powered channel) and subwoofers,  resulting in a combination of effortless power and deep, giving  bass previously unheard of at this price.The obvious benefit of a high-powered amplifier is being able to play it loudly. The RV-B99 exhibited an almost unnerving ability to play louder and louder, forcing us to rest our ears long before we encountered limits in the RV-B99's performance. There was no distortion in the highs and not a hint of compression (or loss of dynamics) in the bass.The less-obvious benefits of heavy-duty amplifiers show up during low-level listening. Lower-powered systemsmightmuster  the loudness of the RV-B99, but they'd never match it for putting  out easy, full-bodied sound at very low volumes (which is where  we found the RV-B99's separate bass-adjust knob the most useful).  The six-level subwoofers worked well enough that we had to roll  them back to two or three at high listening levels. But when playing  music quietly, it was nice to crank the bass up to five or six and  hear lower tones that would otherwise be inaudible.What kind of bass are we talking about? By our measurements, the RV-B99 ""kabooms"" down to about 50 Hz at its loudest, which is low for a portable system. (It takes loudspeakers of substantial size to get good bass in the remaining octave or so below this). The bass-adjust knob works in  conjunction with three equalized presets (Clear, Pop, and Beat) to give you several different ways to tailor the sound for whatever music you're playing.A defeatable JVC feature called Active Clear Sound (ACS) kicks in to emphasize highs when frequencies above a preset threshold are present, the thinking being that the overall audio signal will be  cleaner if this is only active when it needs to be. In practice,  the ""pumping"" from the on-off action of the circuit proved  irritating on more delicate music, but on complex rock material,  it brought a pleasing presence to the treble region.The RV-B99 has a great remote: small and responsive (with fast search and scan times), letting you select tracks  directly from a numbered key pad. We noticed, however, that when  skipping tracks the player clipped the first half-second or so of  the desired song. If you're skipping around or making a cassette  from a programmed sequence, this could be highly inconvenient.The auto-reverse tape player sounds far better than average. (There's no Dolby, but the tape hiss wasn't intrusive.) A host of features--one-touch record, a microphone or guitar input (you can blend either one with CD sound, making it perfect for karaoke), a back-lit LCD  screen, a clock/timer, and a thick shoulder strap with a pouch for the remote control--round out the unit's flexibility.For a feature-packed portable system that plays with equal ease  at high and low volumes, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better unit than the JVC RV-B99.Pros:Great soundHigh powerTons of featuresCons:Cuts in late when skipping to specific tracks",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71MX96RS7XL._SX300_.gif,,,Electronics,Portable Audio & Video,Boomboxes,,,

Pioneer PD-F507 25-CD Changer (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"Feeding the current interest in ""mega"" CD changers is Pioneer's PD-F507 CDFile CD player, a 25-disc file-type changer that stores discs vertically in slots, side by side. Although the PD-F507 is lightweight, the vertical CD storage makes it taller than your average stereo component. Additionally this player offers a number of different playback configurations.The unit itself is simple: a black box on feet with a manual-lift, mouth-like door on the front and a choice of two audio outputs (analog or digital) on the back. The optical digital connection is handy for configuring the PD-F507 with an external digital-to-analog converter for convenience (for example, in a home-theater system) or for better sound, though the standard RCA analog outs sounded fine to us.Once you've loaded your discs, the meat and potatoes of this CD changer are the programming features, most of which are geared for load-it-and-leave-it use. The player lets you program up to 32 tracks across all 25 discs for sequential and repeat playback--including pauses, if you desire. (A pause counts as one selection.) The unit also lets you select and save three different groups of discs, such as albums by your favorite artists, as well as one group of up to 15 favorite tracks with a feature called Best Selection Memory.Other options include Full Random Play, which works within a disc, within a program, or within all discs; Previous Disc Scan, which allows you to audition in reverse order segments of the first tracks of the last 15 albums played in order to locate that special one you can't remember; Programmed Hi Lite Scan, which plays a 10-second snippet of each track in a programmed sequence; and Last Disc Memory, which recalls on power-up the last disc played.The unit handled very well operationally, with intuitive programming and reasonably fast (10-second average) disc-change times. The PD-F507's glossy, dark plastic hood over the disc bay brings life to the attractive front panel, and a back-panel Pioneer SR remote in/out jack fosters system integration with other Pioneer components. In all, a fun and affordable CD  changer, perfect for small CD libraries or large single-sitting appetites!Pros:Flexible playback modesEase of useSystem-integration optionsCons:Random Disc Play only sees the first 17 tracks on any disc",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71SN9RD551L._SX300_.gif,,,Electronics,Home Audio,Stereo Components,CD Players & Recorders,CD Players,

Sony DE441 Discman,"The Sony Discman D-E441's light weight, superior electronic skip protection, and attractive construction are impressive. The portable player also comes with an AC adapter and comfortable headphones.The D-E441's basic features are intuitive and easy to use, and the Discman produces rich and clear sound. What really scored points with us, though, was the host of advanced features, including 22-track programming, resume play, a volume limiter (to protect your hearing), and two repeat modes. The Sony Discman D-E441 also offers two levels of bass enhancement (Mega Bass and Groove), so you can choose between mildly thumping and all-out boombox-style bass. It comes with an audio out, so you can use it with your existing speakers.While the Sony Discman D-E441 can run on two regular AAs, it can also take rechargeable batteries, acting as the charger. The Sony Discman D-E441's most advanced feature is its ESP2electronic skip protection, which uses a digital signal processor (DSP) to store over 20 seconds of music and play it back in the case of a shock. Although we were impressed with the ESP performance in most cases, it doesn't prevent all shocks--you'll still have trouble using the Sony Discman D-E441 during a heavy jog or run.

Panasonic PVDV910 MiniDV Digital Palmcorder Camcorder,"If you're looking for a knockout camcorder, we recommend the Panasonic PV-DV910. With its high-resolution digital format, ultra-compact size, and large selection of useful features, the Panasonic PV-DV910 is our camcorder dream machine. It's a good choice for both home users who want the highest quality audio/video and professionals who want high-end editing capabilities.The Panasonic PV-DV910 isn't much bigger than a point-and-shoot still camera, yet it packs plenty of punch when it comes to recording. It uses the MiniDV format, which gives you over 380 lines of horizontal resolution and lets you download and edit video on your PC (although you do have to purchase a 1394-compliant video capture card separately).The Panasonic PV-DV910 was a pleasure to use. Once we got the hang of the menu wheel, utilizing the host of advanced features was a snap. We particularly enjoyed the wide range of digital effects, from strobe-like recording and negative, sepia, or solarized effects to the multiple fade-in/fade-out options. The Panasonic PV-DV910 also takes still shots--up to 750 on a tape--along with a portion of audio. This is a great feature if you have a video capture card and don't want to buy an additional still digital camera.The 3-inch color LCD viewfinder was big, bright, and clear. It swivels a complete 180 degrees, allowing you to tape yourself or let your subjects see themselves as you record. The Panasonic PV-DV910's 18x optical zoom gave us sharp, clear close-ups, and its amazing 300x digital zoom let us in on extremely far-away action--just be aware that video detail decreases with high digital magnification. We found the PV-DV910's electronic image stabilization helpful in events with fast action or when we were mobile ourselves.One of the Panasonic PV-DV910's best features is its ability to dub audio onto a prerecorded tape. In addition to being able to replace the original soundtrack with new audio, you can also layer a new soundtrack on top of the old one--a great feature for adding background music or commentary. We also found the Panasonic PV-DV910's included light useful for shooting at night or in dimly lit areas.Overall, the Panasonic PV-DV910 was both easy to use and offered a great range of fun and useful features.Pros:High-quality digital video and audioLarge, bright LCD screenHigh-powered optical and digital zoomsTwo-track audio dubbingCons:More expensive than most nondigital camcorders",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71Z4YFFMVGL._SX300_.gif,,,Electronics,Camera & Photo,Video,Camcorders,,
Infinity BU-120 Powered Subwoofer (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"Infinity's BU-120 Powered Subwoofer is everything most  people want in a subwoofer: high powered, flexible, simple to  use, and earth shaking. Tuned well, it's hard to believe there's  really a subwoofer in use; the bass seems to emanate naturally  from the other speakers.A continuously variable crossover (50 to 150 Hz) and level control  allow the BU-120 to blend with nearly any room and system. Achieving the perfect crossover point and volume level will depend entirely on your other speakers and your taste, so suit yourself--this subwoofer lets you. Positioning can be tricky, so if it doesn't sound perfect right off the bat, try moving it around some; a 180-degree phase-invert switch helps  with distances of more than five feet. Infinity recommends placing the BU-120 away from walls, and we found our sweet spot--the point where the subwoofing low frequencies blended seamlessly  with the rest of our system--in fairly short order.Setup, while simple, will depend on how you want to configure  your system, but rest assured that the flexible BU-120 can  accommodate receiver/preamplifierswithdedicated  subwoofer/low-frequency outputs and those without. The flip side  of this flexibility is that the BU-120 wantstwoinputs, a  left and a right, even if you're feeding it a mono, low-frequency  output (as in a Dolby Digital or DTS 5.1-channel system). In that  event, the monaural signal must be split using an RCA ""Y"" cable  (one female to two male, not supplied)--an inexpensive but  inconvenient fix.For dynamic, made-to-order low-end presence at a reasonable  price, the Infinity BU-120 is hard to beat.Pros:Ease of placementFlexible configurationFloor-shaking bassCons:Connecting cables not supplied",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41KBBGVM6GL._SY300_.jpg,293.99,,Electronics,Home Audio,Stereo Components,Speakers,Subwoofers,

Sharp VL-H860U Hi8 Viewcam Camcorder,"The Sharp VL-H860U combines an easy-to-use, unique  design with a super-close-up zoom and special effects to  create a camcorder that's both fun and powerful. Its high- quality Hi-8 format ensures that your videos will be extra sharp  and clear. This camcorder is a great choice for family use.The Sharp VL-H860U's design lets you hold the  camera above your head or facing you while you swivel  the main screen portion toward you. This design is even  more intuitive than the flip-out LCD screen used in most  camcorders. The only drawback to this design is that the Sharp VL- H860U doesn't have an additional optical viewfinder. It  was exceptionally easy to hold and point, however,  feeling more like a large, square film camera than a bulky,  oblong camcorder--plus it is quite an eye-catcher.The Sharp VL-H860U's Hi8 format, a better-quality  version of 8mm film, records clearer,  sharper and more colorful videos than those recorded on VHS,  VHS-C, or traditional 8mm tapes. Hi8 is the best-quality  video you can get short of going digital.The Sharp VL-H860U has up to 22x optical zoom and a  whopping 200x digital zoom--useful for filming sporting events  and other long-distance views. However, raising the magnification reduces the quality of the image. This camcorder comes with a wide range of exposure and special effects options, including backlight compensation, fade, strobe, and picture effects. It also has digital image stabilization,  useful for shaky subjects.Another feature we liked was the Sharp VL-H860U's  single-shot camera ability, which lets you take snapshots  accompanied by sound. Although this camcorder doesn't have the  computer-transfer capabilities of a digital camera, it is still fun to take photos on the tape as well as video.Pros:Unique, easy-to-use designLarge 3-inch LCD screenWide range of exposure and picture effectsStill-shot capabilityHigh-quality Hi-8mm formatCons:No optical viewfinder",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/411VAP2KNXL._SX300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Camera & Photo,Video,Camcorders,,

Connecting this unit to a full set of surround-sound speakers gives you the best audio quality.

Panasonic PV-9451 Hi-Fi VCR with VCR Plus+,"The Panasonic PV-9451 is an excellent performer loaded with features that make it fun and easy to use. Even without reading the instructions, we had this straightforward product up and running in just a few minutes. This VCR sets the time automatically on the front panel and internal clock displays. (The VCR grabs the data from the local PBS broadcast.) Recording a program is easy with the VCR Plus+ feature;TV Guideand many newspapers list a code number for each program and you simply key the number of your desired program into the VCR.Thanks to Panasonic's ""Dynamorphous"" recording heads, pictures held up well even when blown up on a big-screen projection TV and when recording on the slowest (SLP) speed. Hi-fi soundtracks (of action flicks and new concert video compilations) came across full bodied and clean.The onscreen operating menu is another big help in getting the show up and running. It works smoothly with Panasonic's Light Tower remote, which hosts big buttons that glow in the dark when you hit the Light Bulb button.Trick play features are decent on this economically priced VCR. We loved the 1 Minute button, which skips through a 60-second commercial in just eight seconds while offering video scanning onscreen. The PV-9451 has only one fast-forward/reverse speed and one slow-motion speed. In addition, this VCR offers index searching and scanning that pauses at the start of each recording segment on a tape. You can also call up an onscreen program index that shows the time, date, channel, and type (optional) of every timed recording made on a tape, as long as the cassette is in the machine. You can record brief index notes at the opening of tape segments.We have one minor complaint about this VCR: Panasonic's fine-edged recording/playback heads for the SLP mode are excellent if you are watching a slow-speed recording, but they sometimes mistrack when you are watching super long play (SLP) recordings made on older decks. However, standard play tapes--including prerecorded rental tapes--were excellent.Pros:Excellent video and sound qualityEasy-to-use remote, onscreen menu, and VCR Plus+ features1-button commercial skipCons:Tracking problems with some tapes made on other machinesCabinet is smaller than ""standard"" 17-inch-wide components",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31FXCxkHIML._SX300_.jpg,88,,Electronics,Television & Video,VCRs,,,

The cassette deck features Dolby B noise reduction, a music sensor, continuous deck-to-deck play, and high-speed dubbing.CD and cassette capabilities are great for parties, but for a truly outrageous time, you'll want to fire up the karaoke. The NSX-MT920's karaoke features include two microphone inputs, an automatic vocal-reduction mode for making instrumental versions of non-karaoke material, and digital reverberation for better vocal sounds.

Olympus DS-150 Digital Voice Recorder,"The handy Olympus DS-150 digital voice recorder can slip easily into your pocket, purse, or briefcase. It stores up to 160 minutes of dictation and features PC connectivity and IBM ViaVoice voice-recognition software.To set up the DS-150, you first insert two AAA batteries, then program the date and time to ensure that each message receives the correct date/time stamp when you record a message. Recording messages can be done in one of two modes: standard play (SP) or long play (LP). While LP offers more recording time, SP offers better quality, though both modes produce excellent results at a range of volumes. We also found that the quality was best when the recorder was held about 12 inches from the source.The DS-150 has two folders that can each hold up to 99 messages. When you no longer need messages, you can erase them one at a time or erase an entire folder. It can also connect to your PC via a serial cable and convert spoken words into digital text using the included IBM ViaVoice software. With this feature, you can turn any dictation into an instant memo.You can also make hands-free recordings with the DS-150's VCVA (variable-control voice actuator). With the VCVA turned on, the DS-150 begins recording when the microphone detects your voice and stops recording when you stop talking. This means you won't waste memory by recording silence when you pause during dictation, although you may lose brief moments of sound as the recorder starts and stops.All in all, with its many features, PC connectivity, slim design, and easy-to-read LCD, we found the lightweight Olympus DS-150 digital voice recorder to be quite a nice device.--Megan Dugan",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71V7T668G6L._SY300_.gif,199.99,Olympus,Electronics,Portable Audio & Video,Digital Voice Recorders,,,

Philips VT780052 Digital Voice Tracer,"The Philips VG780052 Digital Voice Tracer is more than just a voice recorder. Its 4 MB of RAM can store any type of file--not simply voice recordings--and when plugged into a notebook computer's Type III PCMCIA slot, it is recognized as a 4 MB hard drive.We can imagine a time when gadgets like the Philips VT780052 Digital Voice Tracer will be truly useful, but right now there are far superior and less expensive devices for capturing short voice recordings. The device is a PCMCIA card with a plastic case, built-in speaker and microphone, and controls on the front for making quick recordings. The Digital Voice Tracer is designed to be used with a notebook computer and works fairly well in that regard. Adding and removing files is straightforward, but unfortunately this device isn't the solution for people who need to transfer files from a notebook computer to a desktop PC, as most desktop systems don't have PCMCIA slots.Philips is banking on the fact that people will use the Digital Voice Tracer to send their voice messages via e-mail attachments, but the technology is ill-suited for this purpose. This product records WAV files, which are notorious for their storage inefficiency. The designers tried to get around this by using more efficient 8,000 Hz, 4-bit mono WAV recordings, and it doesn't work well. Those settings require only 4 Kbps of memory for storage, but the sound quality is abysmal. Couple that with the device's tiny, weak speaker and it's nearly impossible to hear the recording without holding the device close to your ear, unless you happen to be in a room that is completely silent. Piping the sound through your PC's speakers helps, but does nothing to improve the sound quality.The Digital Voice Tracer is useful in certain circumstances, but we feel its concept is ahead of its time. Until products with better sound quality and more memory are available, a standard minicassette recorder still is the best way to quickly capture your thoughts, and typing your e-mail still is the ideal way to communicate via a computer.--T.

Sony WMFS499 Sports Walkman,"There's something about the sporty, yellow and silver casing of this unit that makes you want to go out and get in shape. In addition to its good looks, the Sony FS-499 Walkman also boasts a stopwatch/lap counter for the serious exercise buff.This unit's sturdy belt clip has a stabilizing frame to keep it from moving around while you're exercising, and a hand strap offers a sure grip when you're really sweating. The cassette buttons are large and well-spaced, making them easy to push during a hard-core workout; however, we found the number of buttons to be lacking when compared to other portable players. And we had difficulty reading the Play, Fast-Forward, and Rewind buttons while on the run because of sun glare off the casing's silver finish. On the other hand, tuning in AM/FM radio stations was a breeze. The five black, programmable buttons--which program up to 20 different stations--are easily located, as they contrast against the player's yellow surface. We also found the digital display easy to read.Pros:DurableGood soundAuto-reverse feature on cassette playerCan preset up to 20 FM/AM stationsComes with convenient belt clip and hand strapFeatures a stopwatch, lap counter, and clockCons:Battery case is difficult to accessDevice is bulkyHeadphones slightly uncomfortable",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71AHFRY6T7L._SX300_.gif,9.52,,Electronics,Portable Audio & Video,Cassette Players & Recorders,,,

Meade ETX90EC Telescope w/Electronic Controller,"Meade finally brings a serious telescope into thecasual-consumer price range. The ETX-90EC Astro offers extraordinaryoptics at an affordable price. It combines a high-resolution opticaldesign and diffraction-limited imaging with microprocessor-controlled,precise celestial-object tracking, all in a nicely styled, highlyportable package.Improvements to this model include a new forkmount with dual-axis drive system. The ETX-90EC also includes hightorque DC motors on both telescope axes, permitting electronicoperation from the hand-held controller. This push-button electroniccontroller has four dual-axis drive speeds: slow, 8x for imagecentering at high power; medium, 32x for image centering at lowerpower or for pushbutton tracking in altazimuth mode; moderate, 0.75degrees per second for image centering in the viewfinder or forterrestrial tracking; and fast, 5 degrees per second for fast scanningacross the sky.The Meade ETX-90EC is specially designed to beportable and used in the field. It offers cordless operation, allowingyou to use the telescope's dual-axis drive system for more than 40hours on eight AA batteries. At approximately 8 pounds and 15 inchesin length, it packs a lot of power into a compact unit.TheETX-90EC uses a 90mm Maksutov-Cassegrain optical design, and Meadeactually warranties the optics of the ETX-90EC ""to equal or exceed theoptical performance and resolution of any Maksutov optics of similaraperture ever manufactured at any price."" The ETX-Series optics offersuperb contrast, image brightness, and resolution; Meade claims thetelescope consistently outperforms many instruments of largerapertures. Meade also uses EMC super multicoatings on all opticalsurfaces to maximize light transmission through the corrector lens andreflectance from the primary and secondary mirrors. The flip-mirrorsystem allows for 90-degree observation of land and sky objects,straight-through observation using the optional #932 45-degreeErecting Prism, or photo-ready imaging using the optional #64T-Adapter and your own 35mm camera.Overall, the Meade ETX-90EC isa fine piece of craftsmanship at a surprisingly affordable price. Forthose of us who spent our childhood peering through old-style consumertelescopes, using the ETX-90EC is like getting time in the PalomarObservatory. From shifting cloud belts on Saturn to the glowingfilaments of the Orion Nebula, this instrument lets you observe theheavens in extraordinary detail.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41GM8TT2GKL._SY300_.jpg,32.75,,Electronics,Camera & Photo,Binoculars & Scopes,Telescopes,Catadioptric,

In addition, there are four traditional mouse buttons and a trackpad.Problem is, WebRacer wanted to be my only input device. Although Kensington says WebRacer will work alongside your traditional input device (via an adapter), I had to unplug my mouse and tablet (even though I had plenty of available ports) and uninstall their drivers before I could get WebRacer running.WebRacer uses Kensington MouseWorks as its software driver.

Eiger Labs F20 EigerMan MP3 Player,"Eiger Labs, maker of the first portable MP3 player, returns with this second-generation digital music player that's worth a look and a listen. In the F20V, Eiger has streamlined the design of the original MPMan to include more advanced features in a smaller package.MPMan plays MP3 music files downloaded from the Internet or copied from your favorite audio CDs. Typically, an MP3 file contains about one minute of audio per megabyte of information at CD-quality compression rates (128 kilobits per second). The MPMan comes with 32 MB of built-in storage space. However, you can upgrade to 64 MB or store additional music content on separate SmartMedia Flash cards (sold separately). In addition to music files, this unit also supports nonmusic-data files such as .doc, .gif, .txt, and .bmp formats.The provided MPMan Manager software was a snap to use. Once we installed it on our computer, we simply selected the MP3 files that we wanted to transfer from our PC to the MPMan. The files were transferred to the MPMan via the PC parallel port, using the supplied 25-to-18 pin printer cable. (While some other MP3 players require that the player be firmly placed in a docking station, that's not the case with the MPMan.) We were a bit disappointed that we were unable to upload MP3 files stored on our SmartMedia card back to our computer. However, this is because of a copyright protection that is built into the SmartMedia card format, and it's not a flaw in the MPMan.This portable unit is about the size of a pager and comes in its own snug carrying case; we found it to be pleasantly lightweight and compact. Unlike many other MP3 players, the MPMan contains a bass-boost feature that offers 20 decibels of bass enhancement. We were particularly impressed with the crisp, clear sound of the MPMan's earbud-style headphones. In addition, we found that the cushioned headphones fit comfortably in our ears.With advanced features and good sound quality, the MPMan is a good value for anyone looking for an inexpensive, entry-level digital music player.Pros:Topnotch accessories included (comfortable headphones, snug carrying case)No-skip playbackCons:Additional memory cards are expensive",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71V7PN4TWRL._SY300_.gif,,,Electronics,Portable Audio & Video,MP3 Players & Accessories,MP3 Players,,

Toshiba M265 2-Head VCR,"The perfect VCR for the kids' bedroom, or for anyone searching for an affordable 2-head model designed for watching rental tapes and off-air recording. Toshiba's M265 also has a convenient universal VCR/TV remote and an automatic head cleaner to keep the VCR operating at peak performance. The Toshiba Pro Drum with Flying Pre-Amp is an award-winning technology is exclusive to Toshiba VCRs, delivering the best VHS quality available. Toshiba completely redesigned the heart of the VCR--the head cylinder (or drum)--for the sharpest picture and clearest sound ever. The pre-amplifier is built directly into the head cylinder--just like in professional broadcast equipment--eliminating wiring that introduces noise into the audio and the video. The result is a remarkable improvement in picture and sound quality during playback and recording. With Toshiba VCRs, a coating of ions is applied to the Head Drum to give it a negative charge. This helps to repel the dirt that would normally adhere to typical Head Drums. Toshiba remote controls are the best in the industry, consistently winning rave reviews from critics. With an easy to handle, ergonomic design, it puts all the functions of your VCR at your fingertips.  Toshiba's on-screen icons make it easier than ever to utilize all of the advanced convenience features built into your VCR. Just click on the symbols to make your choices.

Beltronics 980 Super Wideband Ka Radar Detector,"The Bel 980 is a terrific radar detector that surpasses most others in its class. We found its performance to be exceptional and its level of customization unbeatable.Out of the box, the Bel 980 is easy to set up and use. However, because of its complexity, you'll need to briefly read the documentation in order to program the unit the first time. After that, you won't have to reprogram the unit unless you set customization modes.You can set the Bel 980 to enter several different modes upon startup. The Standard mode displays several status messages when you power up the unit, while its Quick Start mode bypasses these messages. The Tutorial mode runs through a series of alerts and messages, which can be handy for learning the different alert tones and their associated messages. There's also a Programming mode, which allows you to configure the unit in a multitude of ways. Finally, a Voltage-Meter mode provides a constant display showing how much voltage the radar detector is receiving. This is useful for ensuring that the car's electrical system is producing the correct voltage (although in all modes the unit will alert you if it's receiving a level outside the normal power range).As with some other units in its class, the Bel 980's City mode decreases the alert level, rather than its sensitivity. In this mode, the unit generates an initial alert when it receives a faint signal; however, the Bel 980 then remains silent until it receives a signal strong enough to be of concern. In addition, you can customize the City mode to selectively disable certain radar bands. For example, if you know that the X band is not used within your municipality, you can turn that band off, preventing the unit from picking up common false signals from unrelated sources (such as perimeter alarms commonly found in banks and stores).The Beltronic 980's standard audio alerts are clear and easy to interpret. Each radar band triggers a unique tone, and the large, easy-to-read display indicates which band the detector is picking up. The alert pulses faster as the signal strength increases; a constant tone indicates that a radar signal is in very close proximity. The display also indicates the alert strength in nine different levels. During our testing, the laser alert sounded while we were parked near a neon sign, indicating to us that the Bel 980 may pick up some random signals.When the alarm is sounding, you can press the mute button to silence the alert for the duration of the signal. There is also a programmable setting to automatically mute any new signal that the Bel 980 receives after an initial alert. You can set the display to scroll through long messages (such as those given by the safety-alert system) or to display them word by word. The display also has several brightness modes--the highest level is easy to see, even in bright daylight. There's also a configurable dim mode and a dark display mode. Although the display on the Bel 980 is smaller than on some similar units, it's still easy to read and doesn't impede your ability to interpret alerts.The Bel 980 does have a few weak points (albeit minor ones). The mounting system is tricky to figure out; however, once you install it correctly, the bracket is sturdy and needs no further adjustments. Also, most other units we've tested use a rotary volume control, which makes adjustment easier. The Bel 980 uses a single button to adjust the volume to one of nine settings. Fortunately, once you set the proper volume level, the detector keeps the setting in its memory.Overall, we found the Beltronics 980 radar detector to be a very good value. Its rich feature set and programmability can handle changing driving conditions, and, with a few exceptions, this unit is easy to set up and use.--Dan JamesPros:Exceptional midpriced unitEasy to useHighly customizableCons:Tricky mounting system",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/81HT1MWS2SL._SX300_.gif,,,Electronics,Car & Vehicle Electronics,Vehicle Electronics Accessories,Radar Detectors,,

Ezonics EZ-302 EZCam USB 3-in-1 PC Video Camera,"Often, when ""EZ"" is part of a product's moniker, your internal cheese-meter starts sending out a warning beep. But the Ezonics EZCam USB deserves this abbreviation--it is so simple to set up and use that even the most technophobic can operate it.Since the drivers aren't part of Windows 95 or 98, the software needs to be installed first, but this only takes a few seconds. After rebooting, simply plug the camera into a USB port with the connecting cable and Windows 98 picks it up and installs the driver.The EZCam USB ships with a monstrous software bundle, including four Live Express programs--Video Panel, Send Mail, Card Maker, and Album. The package also features three video programs from Ulead--iPhoto Express, iPhoto Impact Album, and iPhoto Express Explorer--as well as Microsoft's Net Meeting for online videoconferencing with anyone else who has the free software and a camera.The Live Express Video Panel works as smoothly as a VCR--press a button to start recording and press another to pause or stop recording. Once you've recorded a snippet of video, you can save it, send it via e-mail (recipients don't need Live Express; the videos will play on any PC), or insert it into an album. The EZCam also lets you take snapshots with one mouse click.That's not to say the EZCam is perfect. Pictures taken with the EZCam's 100,000-pixel image sensor aren't as sharp as photos taken with a digital camera. And we never got very close to the maximum 30 frames per second that EZCam offers. On the other hand, we were able to run the camera on a 166 MHz Pentium machine quite smoothly and found it very fun and easy to handle.The bottom line is that the Ezonics EZCam is a very affordable and highly useful peripheral. Take a seat behind this camera and you won't be disappointed.--J.

The vertical and horizontal adjustments of 160 degrees pivot to landscape and portrait modes for full-page viewing, which permits multiple users to see the screen without having to sit directly in front of the monitor. ARAG (antireflective, antiglare) screen treatment supports increased accuracy of onscreen images and reduced eye strain.The P810 is ideal for designers and graphics professionals and well suited for desktop publishers who seek a superior screen presentation in a flat, large screen for true flexibility and fine resolution. It also features a pair of 2-watt speakers built into the base, which deliver stereo sound for your multimedia applications. And it includes PerfectPortrait software, selectable text and image-smoothing filters, ViewMatch color controls, gamma adjustments for custom color response, dual USB ports, and advanced ergonomics. Horizontal frequency measures 30 to 95 kHz and vertical frequency measures 50 to 180 Hz. The flat-screen monitor features an ultrafine 0.25-millimeter aperture grille pitch (with 0.27 millimeters at the corners).High-resolution capabilities and distortion-free image quality ensure that your important data and images are precisely displayed. SuperClear technology through optimized glass provides crisp focus and vivid colors. The P810 is both PC ready and Macintosh compatible (with the purchase of a separate Mac adapter). Its dimensions are approximately 20 by 19 by 20 inches, and it weighs a sturdy, substantial 61 pounds. The monitor parts, labor, and the Invar shadow mask picture tube are all supported by a three-year limited warranty.--Barbara Price",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51B0CRD5HAL._SX300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Computers & Accessories,Monitors,,,

With the W-860R, unattended play or recording can extend for six hours using C-90 tapes. Need to make multiple copies of your demo CD? Engage parallel recording to make tapes on both decks simultaneously.Two-speed dubbing lets you make quick copies or dub at the standard, originally recorded speed. A choice of Dolby B or C noise reduction provides recordings with high signal-to-noise ratios and ensures compatibility with most existing recorded cassettes. Deck 2 offers Dolby HX PRO for extended high-frequency response.During playback, music search will fast forward or rewind until the deck senses a break in the recorded sound, providing an easy way to scan a tape for a desired track. And, using CPS (Computomatic Program Search), your track programming can extend across decks 1 and 2.The deck uses an easy-to-read multifunction fluorescent display and offers individual left/right peak program level meters. Each transport automatically senses the tape type being used (chrome, metal, or normal) and adjusts bias and equalization for that particular tape. A four-digit tape counter provides an accurate way to locate a tape segment, and a front-panel headphone jack permits private listening so you can enjoy a cassette without disturbing others.An optional remote control (model RC-544) lets you control the deck from your listening position, and an optional EIA rack mount kit (model RM-860) houses your deck safely and efficiently--perfect for project studio use.What's in the BoxCassette deck, audio cables, a user's manual, warranty information.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41F74RT9P6L._SY300_.jpg,169.99,,Electronics,Home Audio,Stereo Components,Tape Decks,,

Yamaha YSTMS30W 3-Piece Computer Speakers,"Adding new speakers to a computer is one of the easiest upgrades to make, and also one of the most dramatic. Going from the pair of chirping speakers that came with your computer to the Yamaha YST-MS30 will prove this beyond a doubt.The YST-MS30 is a powered speaker set (meaning no amplifier is necessary) that comes with two 6-watt satellite speakers and an 18-watt subwoofer. You control the power and volume from the right speaker and adjust overall bass levels from a dial on the subwoofer. The included speaker cables are long enough to allow for terrific stereo separation. We installed our system in less than five minutes after removing it from the box.A set of YST-MS30s won't get you kicked out of your apartment anytime soon, but there's more to a speaker system than raw volume. Most people are more concerned with the way the speaker reproduces sounds, and it is in this area that the YST-MS30 excels. The satellite speakers produce crisp highs and a full midrange with enough volume to keep the subwoofer from drowning it out. At full volume, the speakers exhibit no distortion, and they don't hiss like inferior products. Better speakers do exist, but you'll have a tough time finding them at YST-MS30 prices.Good subwoofers are nearly impossible to come by in this price range, but the one included with the YST-MS30s is a wonderful exception. Too frequently, cheap subwoofers thump with monotonous bass, with no variation to the frequency or volume of the sounds it attempts to reproduce. This subwoofer provides a nice frequency response, albeit through the limited range all subwoofers are capable of responding to. The result is tight-sounding bass with enough capability for variation.That the speakers sound so good is surprising considering their relatively tiny size. The square subwoofer unit measures only about 7 inches on a side but can be parked anywhere--including under a desk. The satellite speakers that sit upon the desk are very small, measuring less than 3 inches high and wide, and about 5 inches deep. It's a compact design that sacrifices nothing in terms of sound quality, making it a perfect match for a computer system.After a few days with these speakers we really missed not having a headphone jack. It's difficult to find desktop computer speakers with headphone jacks in the first place, so this isn't a serious drawback, but it would make a nice addition. What makes these (and most computer speakers) so great is they use a headphone jack for input, meaning they can be attached to a variety of devices, such as personal CD players, televisions with headphone output, and compact cassette recorders. These devices also can serve as a preamp, allowing you to boost the YST-M30s beyond their standard volume levels and add further versatility to a clean-sounding set of speakers. Anyone looking for a three-piece system would do well to consider the YST-MS30.Pros:Crisp, distortion-free soundSmall speakersResponsive bassEasy to installCons:No headphone jackCould use a little more volume",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71GR6ZMY4EL._SX300_.gif,,,Electronics,Computers & Accessories,Cables & Accessories,Computer Speakers,,

An aluminum-dome tweeter with B&W;'s Nautilus tweeter tube smoothes out the high-frequency response, while an unusual port, which B&W; calls a Flowport, uses tiny dimples, like those on a golf ball, to smooth air movements and thereby lower both noise and distortion.This is serious stuff, and it really seems to work. The 601 Series 2s boast airy, extended high frequencies without a trace of slurring or ringing. Midrange instruments and vocals sound naturally expressive, and the speakers render subtle shifts of pitch and phrasing with ease. Bass response, while not very deep (these aren't floorstanders, remember), is taut and gorgeously detailed. In addition, the 601 Series 2s exhibit a seamless presentation across their frequency range, with no one area jutting out unnaturally.The DM 601 Series 2s are speakers that deserve special attention. They perform well above average at an appealing price, making them one of the best values going.Pros:Detailed, dynamic soundHigh-grade driversGood build qualityCons:Must be placed on dedicated stands for best soundLimited bass response",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41J5GV0JWJL._SX300_.jpg,349,,Electronics,Home Audio,Compact Stereos,,,

The deck is outfitted with such features one-touch recording, one-touch normal and high-speed dubbing, and bi-directional double-deck continuous playback. The latter function is ideal for parties and clubs, as the deck automatically starts playing a second cassette when the first one ends. Professionals will doubtless appreciate the bi-directional recording, which streamlines the recording process, along with the variable +/- 10 percent pitch control--a favorite of DJs looking to speed or slow the tempo.Internally, the W790R is equipped twin IC logic control mechanisms, dual auto-reverse tape transports, and an ultra-reliable Servo motor. Users can follow the progress of their playback and recording on the easy-to-read multifunction fluorescent display and the individual left/right program level meters. The dual four-digit tape counters, meanwhile, make it easy to find a particular program or tape segment on either deck. And to ensure both wide cassette compatibility and elite-level sound, the W790R offers both Dolby B/C noise reduction, which reduces hiss, and Dolby HX Pro, which makes it possible to record loud musical passages without losing the high frequencies or suffering from distortion. Dolby HX Pro is a must for professionas seeking the best possible sound.As with most high-end cassette decks, the W790R also supports synchro-reverse dubbing, along with computomatic program search, intro check, and blank scan functions. Finally, the front-panel headphone jack, which comes with a dedicated volume control, permits private listening so you can enjoy a cassette without disturbing others or cue a tape while another source is playing through your room monitors.At 17.12 by 4.94 by 11.5 inches (W x H x D), the deck fits nicely in Teac's RM-860 rack-mount kit.

You can take it anywhere and listen to your favorite music or make quality recordings of CDs. You can even tape your meetings, thanks to the V-Sensor and NFR (Noise Filtration Recording), which reduce background noise and enhance the frequency of the human voice.

AudioSource SW Fifteen 200-Watt Powered Subwoofer (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"The AudioSource SW Fifteen pounds out 200 watts of low-end power, bringing high-impact slam to action DVDs and greater ambient detail and instrumental heft to your favorite music.A variable low-pass filter (LPF) lets you tailor the sub's output to your existing speakers. By setting the LPF high (toward 180 Hz), you can fill in the bass for bookshelf speakers that may have little bass output. If you use a lower setting (toward 40 Hz), the sub supplements and perceptually deepens the output from larger, floorstanding speakers.You get more than just the basics here: the SW Fifteen comes with a phase-invert switch for placement flexibility (to help align the crests and dips of the different sound waves when the SW Fifteen and your main speakers are in different places) and auto-on signal sensing for power conservation.You can hook up the SW Fifteen in one of two ways. In the first case, you can feed the sub one or two RCA-tipped line-level signals from your preamplifier or surround receiver. (The sub has two inputs, but many receivers offer only one subwoofer output, which is fine.) Using this method, your receiver can most effectively route the LFE (low-frequency effects) channel from Dolby Digital or DTS surround programs directly to your subwoofer. The SW Fifteen offers two RCA outputs (really just throughputs) in case you want to send the signal along to a second subwoofer or power amplifier.Alternately, you can run speaker cable from your receiver to the SW Fifteen and then from the sub's outputs to your front-left and -right speakers. This results in a more seamless transition from the subwoofer to your speakers, as the signal arriving at your speakers has already been filtered through the SW Fifteen's internal crossover (the variable LPF discussed above). If you plan to listen to stereo music with your subwoofer, this might be the way to go.Our biggest gripe with the SW Fifteen is that it offers clip-type speaker terminals rather than banana-type (five-way binding posts). It still sounds good, but just be sure you have pin-tipped cables or bare-wire tips if you intend to use the speaker-cable hook-up method.The SW Fifteen has one feature that few subwoofers at any price offer: a variable-crossover knob that clicks when turned, allowing greater precision in selecting points between 40 and 180 Hz (the 80 and 120 Hz points are marked).The SW Fifteen does an excellent job with power handling. There's plenty of reserve here, and the bass itself plows quite deep. What the sub gains in depth and power, however, it loses in definition--fans of taut, punchy bass might want to look elsewhere (but be prepared to sacrifice some of the ultradeep tones if you stay at this price.With careful placement and painstaking adjustment of both the level and the crossover frequency, the SW Fifteen can be quite pleasing, though, especially when it's supplementing nearly full-range speakers with extra body and low-end solidity.--Michael MikesellPros:Great valueLots of powerProduces deep bassFine-tunable crossover knobRugged constructionFlexible set-up optionsCons:Clip-type speaker-cable terminalsSlightly tubby soundLacks the bass definition of better-made subs",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZVA9GWDSL._SY300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Home Audio,Stereo Components,Speakers,Subwoofers,

You can stack these hefty, durable units on top of one another or place them side by side, depending on your needs. The speakers' high-gloss faux burled-walnut finish imparts a semiluxurious look.Overall setup is a breeze, as is committing radio stations to memory and setting the timer. One functional feature we especially like is the control-panel drawer that slides from the bottom of the tuner/amplifier. The drawer contains the unit's main controls (you can also access these controls from the remote), leaving the faceplate delightfully free of clutter.The XR-M75 sounds best reproducing vocals and small-ensemble or acoustic music at moderate levels. Its overall sound is well balanced but a little on the light side--it doesn't produce a lot of bass, especially by today's standards. When you push the XR-M75 to loud levels on rock music, it audibly distorts, so be sure this mini stereo's abilities match your listening tastes.We've looked at a lot of mini systems, and with its clean design, thoughtful array of features, and ease of setup and operation, the Aiwa XR-M75 is one of the most appealing of the bunch.Pros:Easy to set up and useAuxiliary inputs accept VCR or PC sourcesCan record to auxiliary cassette, minidisc, or CD recorderCons:Doesn't play well at really loud levelsRemote is a tabletop unit, awkward to use with one hand",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41S6N954G1L._SX300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Home Audio,Compact Stereos,,,

Each EQ slider is positioned one octave apart from the others--from 39 Hz to 16 kHz--to correspond with the entire range of human hearing. To adjust the vocal or instrumental balance of a favorite song, merely move the matching sliders up or down (each features 12 dB of boost or cut) until the right level is reached. Identification is simple thanks to the illuminated LEDs (one for each slider). Plus, the device offers a multicolor spectrum analyzer, which interprets the signal levels of the sliders and displays them onscreen. The analyzer not only helps you monitor the audio output, but it also looks ultra-cool when the lights are low.The EQ200 features two A/V inputs that offer the ability to control traditional audio sources, such as a CD player or turntable, along with the audio channels of video sources like VCRs or DVD players. To select an audio source, the listener merely presses the A/V button to the ""in"" position, while leaving it ""out"" controls the video source. Note that the EQ200 only affects the audio of DVD players or satellite systems. It has no impact on the picture, nor does it include any video-type connections. Users can also connect two cassette decks to the unit through the dedicated Tape 1 and Tape 2 inputs and outputs.The EQ200 plugs into your stereo through your receiver's Tape Monitor Loop input. As such, it offers a number of functions specifically designed for connected cassette decks, including a Tape 1-2/Tape 2-1 button that assists you when making tape copies with one deck or dubbing between a pair of tape decks. Listeners don't have to forfeit the traditional recording functions of their cassette decks, either, as the EQ200's tape outputs facilitate recording from the radio, CD, or other sources. Other functions include EQ record, which lets you make a tape copy using a customized equalization curve, and the non-cassette-specific EQ bypass, which allows the user to make comparisons between ""equalized"" and unequalized"" sounds.So of the missing piece to your audio puzzle is the ability to fine-tune your music to meet your demanding tastes, the EQ200 may be a good fit for your system.

Logitech WingMan Force Feedback Mouse,"Logitech's WingMan Force Feedback Mouse is one of those peculiar products whose secondary use is more compelling than its primary one. Designed to complement gameplay, the mouse aims to give mouse-controlled games a jolt, but we found its nongaming uses even more interesting in the long run.The Force Feedback Mouse ships with full versions of three games: Activision'sHeavy Gear II,Railroad Tycoon IIfrom PopTop Software, andGruntzfrom Monolith. Each game shows off how the mouse can be used to enhance gameplay across a variety of genres. InHeavy Gear IIfor instance, machine gun fire caused the mouse to vibrate like a jackhammer run amok. Also, finding one's self on the bad end of a guided missile likewise was a shock. In less action-oriented games likeRailroad Tycoon II, it was interesting to feel a train rumble by as well as see it. But the games that the Force Feedback Mouse is bundled with aren't the only ones that support its technology. In fact, any game that boasts force feedback support should work with this mouse.If the Force Feedback Mouse only had gaming applications, it'd be difficult to fully endorse it. But its practical, nongaming uses are the reason we continue to use it. Utilizing what Logitech calls FEELit technology, in Windows the Force Feedback Mouse allows you ""feel"" items that are being displayed on your screen as the cursor passes over them. For instance, as your cursor scrolls around your desktop, you'll feel it lock on to icons and toolbar items. Within applications, menus and buttons can likewise be felt.Where its uses really shine are in Web browsing. If you've surfed a page with hyperlinks that were difficult to discern, then your troubles are over. Similar to the way the Force Feedback Mouse locks on to desktop and menu items, it likewise locks on to hyperlinks, radio buttons, and the like.The Force Feedback Mouse has a USB interface, so it's simple to connect and configure, but it also requires an external power supply. Furthermore, while the Force Feedback Mouse is fun to use, we found it bulky compared to other mouse/mouse-pad combinations. So if your desktop space is limited or you're already in the midst of a brutal battle with a desktop-cable octopus, you may want to pass on this one.We enjoyed using the Force Feedback Mouse in nearly every game we played, but its limited range of movement--it's attached to the mouse pad/base--made it difficult to use when things got crazy in more frenetic games likeQuake 3: ArenaandUnreal Tournament. All in all, it's a fun, gimmicky device for gaming, but its real usefulness comes into play when you're not even gaming. Being able to feel the desktop and Web pages is enough to keep this mouse on our desktop for a while to come.--Julian StratePros:Easier to navigate desktop and Web pages with FEELit technologyUSB interface means you can use it with a regular PS2 mouse at the same timeSports 3 customizable buttonsCons:Limited range of movementExternal power supply adds more clutter to desktopBulky compared to other mouse/mouse pad combinationsLacks a scroll wheel, which is handy for gaming",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/310J96RFYPL._SX300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Computers & Accessories,Cables & Accessories,Mice,,

Logitech QuickCam Pro USB (PC),"Logitech's QuickCam Pro is the company's first new digital video camera since it bought Connectix's hardware business last year. This solid, well-designed unit rests on a tilt-and-swivel mount attached to the ball-shaped camera's main base. Rubber feet allow the entire unit to sit solidly on a flat surface, but there's also a sliding clip that can attach to the top of a notebook screen, bookcase or other mounting spot.The QuickCam Pro comes in parallel-port and USB versions. I tested the USB model, and installation was simple. The camera's capture software features an excellent interface and a large preview window; it's probably the best image-capture software I've seen with any video camera. The manual focus ring provides a wide and accurate focal range.The camera has a maximum resolution of 640x480 pixels in 24-bit color. In my tests, still-image quality was excellent. Logitech gives you a wide range of image-adjustment options and also automatically optimizes every still-image capture to improve quality. The results are clear, sharp images that display good contrast.The quality of captured moving images was not as good. It is almost impossible to avoid blur, and at the highest resolutions, I was only able to achieve frame rates of 5 frames per second (fps) or less. However, at 160x120 in 16-bit color, I was able to get about 24fps-good enough for video conferencing.The QuickCam Pro also comes with NetMeeting for Internet video conferencing; Web publishing software from Ixla; Adobe PhotoDeluxe 2.0; Digital Arts & Sciences' ImageAXS for cataloging; RealPlayer for video e-mail; and software for creating Desktop themes.While the Logitech QuickCam Pro doesn't match the image quality and performance of the Vista Imaging ViCAM on our WinList, it bests our previous WinList choice for low-end digital video camera, the Xirlink C-It Mobile. Despite its higher price, the QuickCam Pro replaces the Xirlink on our WinList. --From Winmag&#174;",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41EYTQCQA0L._SX300_.jpg,49.97,Logitech,Electronics,Computers & Accessories,Webcams,,,

Plantronics H51M12 Supra Monaural Headset and Modular Amplifier,"Designed for office telephones, the Plantronics H51-M12 monaural headset offers fine audio controls while still allowing you to hear what's happening in your office environment.Unlike simpler units, the Plantronics headset-amplifier combo does take a bit of setting up; you'll need to plug your phone's handset cord into the amplifier's handset, the phone base into the amplifier and your phone's handset outlet, and finally the headset cord plugs into a Quick Disconnect module and the amplifier's headset.Also unlike other headsets, a typical multiline phone will not default to the H51-M12's headset when you press a line button. With this unit, you have to remove the handset from the cradle in order to use the headset. Pressing a line button activates the speakerphone.However, what's lost in simplicity is gained in finer control over both incoming and outgoing audio levels. The volume control on the front of the amplifier controls the incoming volume--that is, what you hear in your ear. On the side of the unit is a slide that controls outgoing volume--what others hear on the line. However, to move this volume slide, you'll need to use a plastic ""screwdriver"" located on the bottom of the unit.The H51-M12 is not for use with cordless phones or units in which the dial pad is located on the handset. For a typical office phone, however, this unit is worth serious consideration.--John Frederick MoorePros:Flexible incoming and outgoing volume levelsGood sound qualityCons:Requires lifting the phone's handset",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/81EY88N2EWL._SX300_.gif,,,Electronics,Accessories & Supplies,Telephone Accessories,Headsets,,

Sony WM-FX671 AM/FM Stereo Cassette Walkman with Digital Tuner,"Sony's WM-FX671 stereo cassette player is barely larger than the size of a standard cassette shell, making it portable enough--and, at just over half a pound--light enough to go anywhere you do. A built-in FM/AM radio broadens its uses, offering one-button tuning for 24 FM stations and eight AM stations. An FM local/distant (DX) switch improves reception of fuzzy stations.The WM-FX671's automatic volume limiter system (AVLS) maintains an even volume level, guarding against unintended level increases and evening the output of musical passages that vary widely in level. Auto-reverse delivers uninterrupted playback of both sides of a cassette, and 16 x fast forward/rewind lets you hear sound at up to 16 times normal speed while the player is in fast-wind mode, helping you locate specific selections quickly. Making searches more specific, the unit's automatic music sensor (AMS) skips forward or backward on the tape across nine songs to play the one you want to hear, while blank skip passes over the blank (soundless) portions at the end of a side, auto reverses, and commences playback with the next side.Mega Bass produces deep, rich bass tones. Groove Sound virtually doubles the bass enhancement of Mega Bass, and a feature called Sound Revitalizer enlivens the music's overall sonic character. An advanced anti-rolling mechanism maintains stable tape speed to minimize music-distorting ""wow and flutter"" while the player is in motion, and automatic shut-off (play/ff/rew) extends battery life and reduces both mechanical wear and tape wear by turning off the player at the end of the tape. Supplied MDR-WO34LP over-ear headphones offer wide dynamic range and clear sound, and the Walkman comes with a rechargeable battery offering up to 50 hours of playback (when used in conjunction with a single standard AA battery, not included).",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41VPXDJFN0L._SX300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Portable Audio & Video,Cassette Players & Recorders,,,

Sony M-100MC Microcassette Recorder with Voice Operated Recording,"This unidirectional microphone minimizes the recording of peripheral sounds and is ideal for recording lectures and presentations. There are three microphone sensitivity modes (lecture, normal, and dictation) which let you select the best pickup sensitivity for recording a wide range of applications, from close-up personal dictation to large meetings.The desktop microphone stand allows the recorder to be set down on a table or desk for hands-free operation. The voice-operated recording automatically activates the recorder only when audible sound is present, conserving tape and eliminating lengthy noiseless passages on recordings. The Clear Voice sound system enhances voice quality during recording and playback for greater clarity. The Cue Marker indexing feature lets you place an electronic ""mark"" at specific tape segments, and provides rapid access during cue and review. The fast playback feature plays tape 20 percent faster than normal speed and reduces the time needed to review recordings.This unit will record up to 19 hours using just two AA batteries. The three-digit tape counter provides a digital display of tape elapsed for rapid access to a particular section of the tape during playback. The LED indicator visibly indicates recording level and condition of battery power in three segments.The playback speaker is unobtrusive and lets you and others hear playback without an earphone. The automatic shut-off helps reduce mechanical wear and conserves battery power. The pause switch temporarily halts recording or playback without leaving that mode, and resumes at the flick of a button. The two-speed operation (1.2/2.4 centimeters per second) feature gives you the option of recording on a standard microcassette for twice its normal time, for extended dictation or recording sessions.This unit also includes a cue/review function that provides sound during fast-forward and rewind modes to help find specific passages. The earphone jack provides individual listening to playback for privacy.Another handy feature is the hinged battery lid, which helps prevent accidental loss or damage.

Hewlett Packard C4464A CD-Writer Plus 8250i,"Hewlett-Packard CD-Writer drives have consistently been stable workhorses, and the CD-Writer Plus 8250i is no exception. Out of the gate, this thoroughbred proves its worth by delivering on advertised speeds and producing readable CDs in every CD-ROM drive we tested--even those burned at full speed. In this age of 8x CD-R drives, it's comforting to know that 4x drives such as the 8250i are not cheap but simply inexpensive and built to handle the rigors of extended service.We found the CD-Writer Plus 8250i to be an excellent addition to a faster CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive. While the 24x read speed is certainly adequate for most applications, its slow random-access speed of 156 milliseconds is readily apparent when compared to that of typical 40x to 50x CD-ROM drives with speeds of 80 to 90 milliseconds. As such, we put the 8250i through the paces by making it a slave of a DVD-ROM drive on the secondary IDE bus. This is the toughest location for any ATAPI burner to be because if burns are likely to fail, they'll fail from here. true to form, the 8250i performed admirably in all tests without producing a single badly burned CD (typically called ""coasters"").If you're a beginner at installing devices like these, we recommend you get some help. The 8250i's documentation is poorly written and lacking in visuals. Otherwise, hardware installation is a breeze. Software comes on one CD-ROM and is easily installed via a single executable file.The CD-Writer Plus is powered by Adaptec-based software; it uses Easy CD Creator 3.5 for creating music and data discs and DirectCD 2.5d for writing to rewritable CD-RW media. If you're new to the world of burning discs, don't worry--HP offers a simple menu-driven interface that ties all the components together quite nicely.When you click on the Create a CD icon, you have four simple choices: make a music CD, copy an existing CD, make a data CD, or make a CD that is compatible with most other CD-ROM drives. We figured this last option would configure Easy CD Creator to burn discs at only 1x speed to ensurefullcompatibility with older drives. Instead, it acted like the make-a-data-CD feature.We used CD Tach from TestaCD Labs to perform all the read benchmarks on the drive. All the sequential read speeds for both CD-ROM and CD-RW media were well within HP's advertised range. Burning discs at the full 4x speed took approximately 23 minutes from start to finish (including the two- to three-minute closing of the disc session), while duping a full CD-ROM took 18 minutes. The software also directly supports the copying of music CDs and the creation of music CDs from digital WAV files. Unfortunately, the included version of Adaptec Easy CD Creator (3.5c) doesn't support the burning of MP3 digital music directly to CD music. This problem only affects older CD-RW drives, however.Once you format a disc, using Adaptec's DirectCD software, you can write the disc to use DirectCD's packet writing technology. This means you can drag and drop files from the desktop or the Explorer directly onto the drive as if it were a large floppy drive. After you remove the disc, you can read CD-RW media in any multiread-compatible CD-ROM and/or DVD-ROM drive.Burning data directly to the 8250i using DirectCD takes around 54 minutes. But as there's a certain amount of overhead associated with packet writing, the total amount of data the HP SureWriter Plus can write to a single piece of CD-RW media is approximately 513 MB. (Read ourFAQfor more info about packet writing and random erase.) After you burn data to CD-RW media, you can delete it, just as you would delete data off a hard drive to free up more space. Generally, writing small amounts of data, such as documents, is instantaneous, while larger 13 MB files take well over a minute. Deleting files is much faster though--an included CD-RW Erase utility destroys all formatting on a CD-RW disc.We found the HP CD-Writer Plus 8250i to be an excellent drive and a great value in its price range. If you want a burner that gets the work done, without any bells and whistles, we recommend you give the HP 8250i a try--you won't be sorry.Pros:Never produced a buffer-underrun (bad burn)Performed to advertised specificationsSoftware install was simple and well documentedCons:Poor documentation",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/114EC4GTN1L.jpg,,,Electronics,Computers & Accessories,Computer Components,Internal Optical Drives,Internal CD Drives,

The N70 also offers both spot and wide-area autofocus--the latter is especially handy when you want to loosen up your composition.The Nikon N70 uses 3-D matrix metering for incredibly accurate exposure. An SPD (Silicon Photo Diode) sensor divides scenes into eight segments; the N70's microcomputer then reads the light pattern for data on brightness and calculates contrast to put out optimum exposure value. The Nikon N70's built-in speedlight flash uses a five-segment TTL multi-sensor for optimal flash balance.In addition to standard program, manual, and shutter- and aperture-priority modes, the Nikon N70 offers bracketing and a useful mode called flexible program, which lets you shift the combination of shutter speed and aperture normally set by the program mode.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/710DJTWBF2L._SX300_.gif,13.59,,Electronics,Camera & Photo,Film Photography,Film Cameras,SLR Cameras,

NHT SuperZero Bookshelf Speaker (Single) (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"NHT (Now Hear This) has been making waves in high-end audio for some  time, offering solidly designed speakers at prices far lower than their stunning  sounds would lead you to expect. The SuperZero is a marvelous bookshelf design,  delivering sweet and seamless sound across most of the audio spectrum. In our  tests we found that the speaker rolls off bass in the bottom couple octaves,  making it most suitable as a satellite speaker in a home theater (and it's sold  singly, so you can buy five if you decide to go the home theater route).The speaker is quite plain to look at, but this only makes it all the more  stunning when you fire it up and hear its gloriously natural midrange and mellow  but perfectly detailed high frequencies. And we have no trouble recommending  this as a bookshelf speaker for close quarters--say, a bedroom or dorm room,  where placement near a wall will emphasize whatever bass is there. Additionally,  asubwooferwill do a great  deal to fill in the low end.Timbrally, apart from the drop-off in the low end, this speaker is spot on.  Voices, acoustic instruments, electric guitars, drums, synthesizers--you name  it, this speaker does it justice, letting you lose yourself in a musical  presentation for hours on end without strain or fatigue (provided you're not  playing them too loudly, of course. This is a definite temptation). We were  simply astounded at how NHT's SuperZero played us not so much the sound as themusic, the true test of any speaker's mettle.The SuperZero's speaker terminals are rugged five-way binding posts, and the  backside comes with two threaded holes for wall mounting. Wall placement,  whether the SuperZero isonthe wall or merely near it, will beef up the  bass a bit, but we found that it sounded the most natural with 2 or 3 feet of  space on all sides (stands are not included).--Michael MikesellPros:Gorgeous soundOutstanding timbral balanceIncredible quality for the priceCons:Lack of bass",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41R6S2T1G6L._SY300_.jpg,99.95,,Electronics,Home Audio,Stereo Components,Speakers,Bookshelf Speakers,

NHT 2.5i Floorstanding Speaker (Left/Single Speaker) (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"NHT loudspeakers are designed to deliver refined music in an attractive and affordable package. Every NHT speaker undergoes rigorous testing and quality control at the factory to ensure years of listening pleasure.The Model 2.5i represents a new approach to three-way loudspeaker design. By integrating the components and design principles of NHT's critically acclaimed compact speakers with a built-in subwoofer, the 2.5i delivers the clarity and precision of the finest two-way designs along with the dynamic range of much larger loudspeaker systems. Inside the Model 2.5i are two separate chambers. The midrange and high-frequency drivers are housed in a sealed subenclosure and are located on a narrow front baffle to improve imaging. The 8-inch long-throw subwoofer is housed in a separate vented enclosure and is mounted on the side of the cabinet for consistent bass loading. Incorporating NHT's proprietary Focused Image Geometry design, the Model 2.5i's custom-designed drivers and enclosure achieve a level of tonal neutrality and imaging precision unsurpassed at their price.NHT's Focused Image Geometry design determines the 21-degree angle that defines the 2.5i's cabinet, as well as the sound-radiation pattern of the system. The irregular enclosure shape greatly increases the ratio of direct-to-reverberant sound, reducing side-wall reflections and concentrating sound in the listening area. The exact angles at which the sound from the speakers reaches the ears of centrally located listeners is calculated to create what is known in acoustics as minimum ""interaural cross-correlation."" This technique allows the Model 2.5i to properly recreate the natural acoustic ambiance and perspective contained in good recordings. In addition, the radiating axes of the left and right speakers are crossed, providing ""time-intensity trading,"" so that the stereo image remains focused and stabilized in a wide range of listening positions. The cabinet shape also reduces the formation of internal standing waves, resulting in smoother midrange response.Focused Image Geometry is the heart of NHT's high-performance audio loudspeakers. The Model 2.5i employs custom-designed European drivers, including an offset aluminum-dome tweeter that boasts extremely smooth response, even at high listening levels. Its 6.5-inch midrange and 8-inch woofer are the result of extensive in-house development and are custom manufactured for precise roll-off and radiation characteristics.With the increasing popularity of home theater systems, many audio-video enthusiasts are building combined entertainment systems for both music and movies. When the Model 2.5i is used in a home theater system, be sure to augment it with timbre-matched speakers to ensure a seamless soundfield.Some audio enthusiasts have found that bi-wiring can bring about improvements in sound. Bi-wiring is the use of two pairs of speaker cable and one amplifier, with each pair connected to one set of binding posts on the amplifier (some two-channel amplifiers provide two sets). To bi-wire the 2.5i's, connect the top pair of binding posts to the amplifier with one speaker cable, and the bottom pair with a second cable. The two sets of speaker cable are both connected to the same pair of terminals on the amplifier.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21T77JKMD1L._SY300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Home Audio,Stereo Components,Speakers,Floorstanding Speakers,

Olympus Stylus Epic QD CG Date 35mm Camera,"The durable Olympus Stylus Epic offers full-featured, high-quality 35mm operation in an affordable package. With this ultra-portable point-and-shoot--one of the smallest 35mm cameras available--you'll never leave your camera at home.While it's extraordinarily light and small, the Olympus Stylus Epic is heavy on styling and great features. It sports a miniature version of Olympus's signature clamshell sliding case, making it easy to turn the camera on and off. Its good-looking, high impact case is durable and splashproof.The Olympus Stylus Epic offers the advanced features of Olympus's larger camera lines, including quartz date and time imprinting and a self timer.  The Olympus Stylus Epic also has a whopping six flash modes, including automatic, red-eye reduction, and night scene.The Olympus Stylus Epic was a pleasure to use--it was as small or smaller than many of the new Advanced Photo System (APS) cameras, but uses standard 35mm film. Its tapered design made it easy to slip in a pocket, and since it was little larger than a deck of cards, we found ourselves carrying it everywhere. If you hate lugging even a normal-size point-and-shoot around, the Olympus Stylus Epic has the portability you need.Pros:Extremely lightweight and compactDurable constructionWide range of flash optionsAffordableCons:Battery compartment is hard to open",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/718ADSMTMHL._SX300_.gif,13.59,,Electronics,Camera & Photo,Film Photography,Film Cameras,Point & Shoot Film Cameras,
Epson PhotoPC 800 2.14MP Digital Camera,"The PhotoPC 800, Epson's newest addition to its digicam fleet. is nicely armored in brushed aluminum with charcoal trim, and is small enough to be a true ""pocket battleship."" Its 2.1-megapixel firepower can take aim at any target you want to blow up to 8 by 10 inches or larger.But like any ship of the line, it has some vulnerabilities that may prove troublesome. Unlike most digicams, the PhotoPC uses 3.3 volts rather than 6 to power the camera's LCD monitor, internal electronics, and flash. Two AA's just can't cut it, even if they're rechargeable NiMHs (Four batteries plus a charger come standard). As a result, you cannot use the LCD monitor for more than 10 seconds at a time if you want to get more than a couple dozen pictures (with flash) out of a set of batteries. It's possible to set the LCD to stay on for up to 3 minutes (and you may need to if you're using accessory lenses with the optional lens adapter), but your batteries will die quickly, especially if you're also viewing pictures in the playback mode. So get ready to shoot most of your pictures through the PhotoPC 800's optical viewfinder.Epson has given the PhotoPC 800 multiple personalities that can interact with beginning, intermediate, and advanced photographers. However, the unorthodox menu system is difficult to master. There are seven different buttons on the camera, each of which can perform multiple functions, depending upon the choices that appear on the adjacent screen. Even the well-written 224-page manual demands quite a bit of attention before things start to fall into place.The beginner's setting turns the camera into an entirely automatic (including focus), typical point-and-shoot. You can set various program modes in the intermediate level depending on the kinds of shots you want: action, landscape, or portrait, Advanced mode allows adjustment of lens openings (either f-2.4 or f-8), shutter speeds and distance presets. Beware, though--setting shutter speeds manually (1/2 to 1/750 seconds) doesn't set the appropriate lens openings, so you should use that feature to deliberately overexpose or underexpose in unusual lighting conditions or for special effects.The PhotoPC 800's top-mounted dial lets you select seven modes: set-up, printer-direct, playback, off, optical viewfinder only, optical viewfinder and LCD monitor, and continuous (and interval) shooting. The camera's three-button top deck LCD handles critical functions such as resolution, flash, and the self-timer. It'll also give you an instant read-out on the ISO (sensitivity to light), white balance setting, number of pictures left, and battery condition. Holding the camera is a bit awkward because you have to pinch the top and bottom of it with the thumb and forefinger of your left hand to avoid obstructing the lens (an accessory pistol grip would help a lot here). And like most small digicams, it comes with only a wimpy wrist strap.Despite obvious shortcomings, the PhotoPC 800 has many impressive features that make it a real contender. It can shoot at 1,600-by-1,200-pixel resolution with two compression choices, and it can render the obligatory 640 by 480 for the Web. There's even an interpolated mode called HyPict that ups the resolution to 1,984 by 1,488 pixels inside the camera before the picture is compressed, so that all the captured raw data is used. Of course, you lose a little sharpness, but you can easily correct the image before you print it with an image editing program.Other good attributes are fast-interval shooting (about a picture per second) at 1,600-by-1,200-pixel resolution, a burst mode that can work in conjunction with the self-timer (so you can analyze your golf swing), and a time-lapse function you can use to shoot pictures at intervals from 10 seconds to 24 hours. You can also set exposure for each shot, operate the camera from your Mac, and use USB to transfer the images. If you make presentations, this may be your dream digicam. You can ad voice comments in 3-, 5-, and 10-second sound bites either as you shoot or afterward, exclude pictures you don't want to show, and rotate pesky verticals. You can also upload existing computer presentations for display on a TV or with an AV projector, or for easy transfer to video-tape. Finally, the PhotoPC 800 prints directly to the Epson StylusPhoto, , 700, 750, 1200, and Stylus Color 740 printers without using the Mac.Both the PhotoPC 800's 2X digital zoom and its panorama settings cut the camera's effective resolution in half, and the macro settings can only get in to about 6 inches. However, the proof of the pudding is in the output, and after getting comfortable with the camera and printing some large, luscious, almost artifact-free photographs, we found that the PhotoPC 800's somewhat complex mix of elements does indeed produce exquisite pictures. So if you're at ease with button-pushing and have deep pockets for extra batteries, this may be just the camera for you. --Arthur BleichGood News:Images to 11 by 14 inches. Fast interval shooting.

KLH 1230SB 170 Watt 3-Way Floorstanding Speakers (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"The KLH 1230-SBs are exceptionally affordable three-way floor-standing speakers. They are capable of filling even large rooms with their full, rich sound, and they have good bass wallop.Like most modestly priced speakers, the 1230-SBs are not particularly sexy to look at--they have a generic black-ash vinyl veneer and black grille cloth. Their connectors are of the simple spring-loaded variety, which only accept bare or tinned speaker wire.However, the beauty of these speakers is more than skin deep. We were impressed, for example, by their driver complement. Not only is each driver of very good quality, but KLH has done an excellent job of integrating their sound. The 1230-SBs have the kind of tonal integration we hope for but don't always find in moderately priced models. This type of coherence makes these speakers easy to listen to for extended periods of time.In our tests, high-frequency response was extended and airy, and the sound of cymbals, which can easily get tizzy (especially in inexpensive speakers), sounded natural. The midrange area, the most important frequency range in audio, was likewise very good. Typical instruments in the midrange, such as vocals, piano, sax, and cello, were all well-defined, harmonically rich, and open sounding. And the 12-inch woofer not only packs a punch, but it has good definition, too.If you're looking for all-around good speakers that are well-made, sound good, and don't need a lot of power to make them sing, the KLH 1230-SBs are an excellent choice.Pros:Big, full soundVery good driversEasy to driveCons:Plain looksCheap connectors",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/410ST63V2DL._SX300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Home Audio,Stereo Components,Speakers,Floorstanding Speakers,

Its miniature version of Olympus's signature clamshell sliding case makes it easy to turn the camera on and off, while offering protection against lens scratches. It comes in a good-looking and durable brushed champagne gold case that is splash-proof, so you can shoot pictures in all kinds of weather.

KLH AV5001 Floor-Standing Speaker (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"Talk about a lot of bang for the buck--KLH's AV5001 floorstanding speaker provides just that with a 12-inch woofer and a 12-inch passive radiator for deep, powerful bass. For the remainder of the frequency range, KLH uses a 5.25-inch liquid-cooled midrange cone and a 1-inch liquid-cooled dome tweeter. And because the AV5001 has high sensitivity, you can drive it to ear-crunching indoor levels with just about any amplifier.The AV5001, which comes in a black-ash vinyl veneer, is relatively large and designed to sit directly on the floor. (You may want to consider wedging rubber feet or cones under the AV5001 in order to keep all of that bass energy from resonating through your floorboards instead of radiating into your room.) As far as hooking up the AV5001, we weren't crazy about the spring-loaded wire-clip terminals. Five-way binding posts would be more rugged and convenient. Otherwise, the AV5001 appears to be a solidly made speaker.Sonically, it may not be the last word in subtlety and nuance, especially for jazz and classical fans. But then, refinement is the last thing needed for some music. If you love to hear a Marshall stack churning waves of thrashing guitar notes, or a kick drum delivered with the room-rattling power of a crashing safe, or pants-flapping drum and bass, then the AV5001 will have you on your feet and dancing. In addition, vocals sound clear and strong, and the top end has plenty of shimmer and zing. Overall, the AV5001 is a clean and powerful speaker.No one speaker can satisfy everybody, and KLH's AV5001 probably won't get your juices flowing if you're into classical or acoustic music. But if you like hard-hitting music that's rich in bass and treble, the AV5001 will make it come alive.--Wayne GarciaPros:Powerful, dynamic bassEasy to drivePlays loud without strainCons:Bass can be overpoweringClip-type speaker terminals require bare-wire cable",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31MW46G222L._SY300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Home Audio,Stereo Components,Speakers,Floorstanding Speakers,

3dfx Voodoo3 3000 PCI 2D/3D Graphics Accelerator,"Looking for a no-frills PCI graphics card that can kick your anemic 3-D games into high gear? Consider the Voodoo3 3000 PCI from 3dfx. This 16 MB graphics card supports more 3D APIs than many competing products, offers glass-smooth performance for most games, and won't break the bank.We were a little disappointed when we opened the box, as the Voodoo3 3000 comes with no software bundle. A voucher is included for a software DVD decoder, but it would be much better if 3dfx just included the software with the device. It is immediately obvious upon looking at the card that few extra features are supported, as there are no TV input or output jacks. It's a graphics card, plain and simple.The first thing you'll notice after installing this card and booting up a game is its speed. We tested it with over 15 popular 3-D games, from flight simulators likeJane's USAFto first-person shooters likeUnreal Tournament. The results were universally impressive, with games running smooth as glass at all but the highest resolutions. The Voodoo3 3000 works particularly well with games that use 3Dfx's Glide API, likeUnreal Tournament. We were used to running that game with a RIVA TNT card at a resolution of 1,024 x 768, with both the detail settings at medium. We witnessed much smoother performance from the Voodoo3 3000 at this resolution with the detail settings at high.The caveat to all this speed is that it comes at the expense of maximum color depth. While the Voodoo3 3000 supports 32-bit color for normal 2-D acceleration (like working in Windows), it only goes as high as 16-bit for 3D-accelerated programs. This is not a big problem when it comes to games released in the last year or so, but more titles today are optimized for 32-bit color, and it's a shame this card can't handle it. It is obvious 3dfx focused on fast frame rates over all other considerations, but the fact that 3dfx's newer video card designs incorporate 32-bit color for 3-D proves the company has seen the errors of its ways.Two other potential drawbacks had less of a performance impact than we expected. The first is that this card supports only 16 MB of video memory. Most other cards on the market ship with 32 MB, making this seem a little skimpy. In practice, you'll have nothing to worry about. Windows performance is excellent, as the card supports 24-bit color at a maximum resolution of 2,046 x 1,536 and a refresh rate of 75 Hz. These numbers represent pure overkill for any monitor smaller than 24 inches, so users with 17-inch or 19-inch displays should have no complaints about Windows performance. Since only 16-bit color is supported in 3-D mode, the 16 MB of RAM is adequate to push enormous numbers of pixels at resolutions and refresh rates that should satisfy any gamer with a 17-inch or smaller monitor. Those of you with 19-inch or larger monitors may want to look elsewhere for a gaming card that will extract maximum performance from your display.The other reason buyers may hesitate to buy this card is that it's a PCI device. With so many computers shipping with AGP support, it makes little sense to buy a video card that uses a slower interface technology. Frankly, we didn't notice any difference. We've tested dozens of AGP cards with 16 MB of RAM, and the PCI version of the Voodoo3 3000 was able to best many of them--at least in 16-bit color. The good news is that this product is available in an AGP version, so you don't have to compromise if it really troubles you. The only real benefit we can see in using the AGP version of this card is that it will free up a PCI slot, which you can use for other devices.Overall, if you have a 17-inch monitor and high 3-D color depths are not important, the Voodoo3 3000 PCI is a smooth operator that can really make your games come to life. If you are looking for the ultimate video card, or a card with extra features like TV output, take a pass--and prepare to shell out two to three times the amount of cash you'd spend on this product.Pros:Smooth performanceGlide compatibilityGreat Windows performance, considering memory limitationsCons:No 24- or 32-bit color in 3-DOnly 16 MB of video RAMNo software bundle",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51V58ZN9V0L._SX300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Computers & Accessories,Computer Components,Graphics Cards,,

DiscRestore 3685 DiscRx for DVD Pro Series 1,"If you're reading this you've undoubtedly already discovered that your growing collection of music CDs, DVDs, laserdisc movies, computer CD-ROMs, and video game discs isn't quite as ""indestructible"" as we were all once led to believe. The sad truth is that playability of our digital discsisaffected by what often appear to be relatively minor surface scratches and abrasions, whether they're caused by the discs being dropped, caught in a disc tray, or simply stored without their protective jewel boxes and sleeves. Regardless of the cause, it's very likely that sooner or later you'll have some discs that just don't work or that skip on certain tracks.The good news is that there's now a safe, convenient, and affordable way to restore virtually all damaged discs to their original functionality, and on average it takes only two to three minutes of your time. The patent-pending DiscRx Rx4 Advanced Formula kits from DiscRestore International provide you with an easy and highly effective alternative to having to replace your expensive, often irreplaceable, media.It's so simple, it's as easy as 1, 2, 3:Place a damaged disc face down on a clean, nonabrasive surface (towels work great).Apply five drops of DiscRx Repair solution evenly to the exposed data side of the disc.Using the supplied blue OptiCloth (made of 100 percent lint-free cotton), rub the DiscRx Repair solution into the disc surface, rubbing from the inner to outer edge while rotating the disc with your other hand. Complete two revolutions (or until the DiscRx Repair solution is no longer visible).Repeat the above three steps using the DiscRx Care solution and the white OptiCloth, and your disc will be restored to full playability as well as protected against further damage.Severely damaged discs (about 10 percent, based on current real-world experience) might require a second application of DiscRx Repair solution or, alternatively, application of the supplied UltraFine polishing strips. Our field tests and feedback from satisfied DiscRestore users all over the world repeatedly show that DiscRestore is 98 percent effective in restoring damaged discs, regardless of the extent of the damage. There is nothing that is more effective than DiscRestore for restoring, protecting, and improving damaged or malfunctioning digital media.Protect your restoredandnew or undamaged discs:Not only does the proprietary DiscRx system restore your damaged discs, it also provides a means to protect them from further damage. Use the DiscRx Care solution as above (except this time using the white OptiCloth), and in just a minute or two your disc will be effectively protected against further scratches and abrasions. We highly recommend that you use this procedure to protect your good or undamaged discs, and we even provide self-adhesive stickers in each kit so that you can easily label which discs in your collection have already been protected by DiscRestore.Improve audio and video playback performance:That's right! Use of the DiscRx system not only restores your damaged discs and protects them against further damage, but many serious audiophiles and videophiles have reported improved performance after using our system. While a number of factors outside of our control--disc mastering and manufacturing processes, type and condition of player, associated electronics, etc.--can affect playback of music and movies from digital discs, we have heard from a number of DiscRestore users that they have noticed improvements in both audio and video detail and clarity after treating their collections.Developed in California's Silicon Valleybyprofessionsforprofessionals:In 1989 DiscRestore inventor Martin Perches conceived a synergistic, two-step process to restore playability to damaged audio CDs. As a successful inventor in the consumer electronics field as well as an avid audiophile, he had already noted that dust, scratches, and surface imperfections could render this supposedly indestructible new medium unusable by impeding the flow of information from the disc to the player. He was able to utilize sophisticated test equipment and facilities in California's Silicon Valley to test and develop his theories until he had perfected what is now the patent-pending DiscRestore system. An instant hit with professionals in the newly emerging field of digital media development and production, which soon expanded from audio to video and then data storage and playback, DiscRestore is now available as an safe and easy method for consumers to also restore, protect, and improve their digital collections.No machines, no harmful solvents:Unlike some competing products, the DiscRestore system is completely safe to use and requires no costly machines or harmful solvents to fully restore usability to all forms of digital discs.

Koss PC 68 CD Boombox,"If you favor a sleek look, modest sound, lots of features, and a bargain price in your music machine, the Koss PC 68 CD boombox is a good bet. Tastefully designed in silver and black, this boombox has curvaceous lines, a disappearing handle, and nice metal grille.Rap lovers will probably find the box's bass inadequate, even with the 7-watt superwoofer cranked to the max. But for playing wide-open pop, jazz, country, and folk, the PC 68's sound is reasonably detailed and natural. The bass is decently articulated; guitars, pianos, cymbals, and steel drums sound reasonably accurate; and saxes show some sass. With a good set of headphones, music on the Koss PC 68 sounds even better.Running the show is a low-key exercise. Thanks to the well-designed (and color-coordinated) infrared remote control, you can skip across the digitally tuned AM/FM radio bands. In fact, you can program up to 20 station presets and access them via the unified up/down/search/skip toggle button on the remote. Other controls on the remote manipulate volume, switch the radio band between FM and AM, and instantly mute the sound.A multitude of rubbery controls on the remote--duplicated on the face of the box--are dedicated to operating the top-loading CD player. Tap the Intro button, and the player automatically delivers just the first 10 seconds of each track on a CD. This feature is useful when you're searching for a particular song or want to quickly audition an unfamiliar disc.The built-in tape deck, also top loading, lets you make custom-mixed tapes from CD or radio. The tape deck is basic--there's no Dolby noise reduction, auto-reverse, or remote-controllable operations--but it gets the job done. For best recording results, use a name-brand, normal-grade ferrous-oxide tape. More expensive varieties will actually sound poorer because the tape deck is equalized for Normal/Type I cassettes.With a fair amount of metal on board and solid construction throughout, this Koss has more heft to it than other boomboxes in the same size range. When loaded up with eight D-cell batteries, it can seem a little heavy when you're lugging it around by the handle.Pros:Attractive designEasy operationVersatile CD, radio, and tape functionsCons:Not a lot of boomMinimalist tape deckRather heavy for its size",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51N975DA4WL._SX300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Portable Audio & Video,Boomboxes,,,

Yamaha includes trifield processing as well as Dolby Surround Pro, Dolby Digital, and DTS processing. Yamaha's exclusive digital sound-field musical processing recreates the acoustic personalities of actual concert halls such as the Roxy Theater in Los Angeles, the Village Gate in New York, Anaheim Stadium, and churches throughout Europe. Its 35mm and 70mm cinema DSP multiply the effects of Dolby Pro Logic and Yamaha's DSP to provide the best possible Pro Logic movie-theater recreation in your home.Delivering 85 watts to each of the five channels, the RX-V795 uses discrete power transistors rather than IC chips to provide the cleanest sound possible. Yamaha employs single function application specific integrated circuits (ASIC) for the RX-V795. ASICs are more efficient than multifunction chips and provide the most accurate decoding possible.

"JBL S310 3-Way Floorstanding Speaker (Single Speaker, Black Ash) (Discontinued by Manufacturer)","The JBL S310 is a 3-way, 10-inch floor-standing loudspeaker with medium-density fiberboard (MDF) enclosure and Elliptical Oblate Spheroidal (EOS) wave guide for wide, even sound dispersion. Technical specifications include a 40 to 20,000 Hz (+/- 3 dB) frequency response, 8 ohms nominal impedance, high 91 dB sensitivity, and 200-watt power handling.

JBL NSP1 5-Piece Home Theater Speaker System (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"JBL's NSP1 is a compact home-theater speaker package assembled from two models in JBL's Northridge series, the N24 bookshelf speakers and the N-Center center-channel. JBL's goal with Northridge is to bring its extensive professional-audio experience home to consumers at affordable prices. After spending some time with the NSP1 system, we'd say that JBL has more than realized that goal.The N24 bookshelf (the system employs four of these speakers to furnish the left and right front and surround channels) is the smallest of the eight Northridge models. Each speaker in the series uses identical 0.75-inch titanium-laminate dome tweeters and woofers made of JBL's PolyPlas, a polymer-coated cellulose fiber. (Three-way models also contain PolyPlas midrange drivers.)Each N24 contains one 4-inch woofer; the N-Center has two 5-inch woofers. These custom-designed drivers benefit from technology that's been borrowed from JBL's professional models, such as Kapton voice coils and HeatScape motor structures, which endow the drivers with tolerance for high temperatures. (In speaker parlance, that means ""high volume levels."") Robust power handling is a good thing for any speaker and especially with the wide dynamics required of home-theater models.JBL's Straight-line Signal Path (SSP) crossover networks route the audio frequencies to their respective drivers and smooth the speakers' frequency and power response, while minimizing processing that could otherwise degrade your audio signal.These speakers are housed in rich-looking, dark-gray cabinets with bow-shaped backs and matching grille cloths. A welcome visual change from the usual rectangular box, these curved enclosures are also designed to combat the buildup of standing waves (uneven acoustical pressure that can unfavorably color the sound).Remove the grille cloth and you'll see the gleaming titanium-laminate dome tweeter and silver-dyed PolyPlas woofer. You'll also see JBL's flared FreeFlow port, which extends bass response and increases sensitivity without adding port noise, sometimes heard as ""chuffing.""For speaker terminals, all components of the NSP1 use five-way, nickel-plated binding posts, and JBL thoughtfully includes a plastic socket-style key to tighten them. (Binding posts offer the tightest and most flexible speaker connections, accepting spade lugs, banana plugs, and bare or tinned wires).You can mount the N24s on walls, shelves, or stands. If you elect to mount them on a wall, which yields the deepest bass response, you can place them either vertically or horizontally. They also swivel side to side and, once tweaked to your satisfaction, lock into place (brackets and hardware are included). If you opt for shelf or stand placement, however, you should place the supplied rubber pads under each speaker to prevent slipping. Either way, make sure the front speakers are equidistant from the sides of your television and are poised at ear level with your seated viewing position. If you mount them above ear level, aim the speakers toward the listening zone.You can place the rear channels above, below, or even at the same level as your listening position. Remember that for home theater, the goal is to achieve a nonlocalized sound field--that is, one where the sound is diffuse and spacious rather than rendered with pinpoint accuracy, as you usually want for the front speakers. Surround speakers usually work best when placed well above the listening zone, with the sound reflected off the side walls or ceiling.Multichannel music, however (such as that found on DTS-encoded 5.1-channel CDs), is generally mixed with precise localization in mind, so do take your listening preferences into account when setting these up. Fortunately, the N24s' swiveling brackets let you experiment with placement and angle for the best results.Center-channel speakers do not afford the same flexibility, and the N-Center is not unusual in this regard. In order to fix dialogue with the picture from your television, the N-Center must be placed at approximately the same level as your screen, either sitting on top of the TV or below it on a shelf.As for the NSP1 system's sound, starting with music only, the first thing you'll notice is that it produces surprisingly full audio. Jazz CDs sound rich and clear, but don't expect bass and drums to plumb the bottom depths of the frequency range. Trumpets and saxophones come through with terrific, brassy texture and bite, but (predictably) not as much detail or sense of air as they might if heard through costlier speakers. Vocals are uniformly good--articulate, focused, and well balanced. With orchestral music, the N24s throw a relatively wide soundstage, with more than a hint of depth (that is, of the sonic space extending beyond the speakers). But rock fans will almost surely want to add a subwoofer to feel the full impact of their favorite bands.With DVD-videos, vocal clarity is enhanced by the N-Center, which does a great job of routing the dialogue to the screen. Considering its small size, the complete NSP1 system exhibits very good dynamics, and JBL's close attention to driver matching yields a seamless transition from speaker to speaker, creating a wonderfully complete sonic environment.Adding a subwoofer to the NSP1 brings out the full glory of 5.1-channel sound (having, as it does, a dedicated low-frequency effects channel--the "".1"" in 5.1), and it's worth noting that subwoofers not only make a big difference with action films but bring fullness to all program material, whether cinematic or musical. (With a sub in the system, the main speakers no longer have to reproduce bass frequencies, and everything becomes much clearer and cleaner. Additionally, your amplifier can focus on frequencies that are easier to reproduce, leaving the tough stuff to the amp in your subwoofer.)To say that JBL has a good reputation in the pro-audio world is an understatement. A staggering 70 percent of the world's theaters, concert halls, and recording studios are equipped with JBL speakers. With the NSP1, JBL brings that experience home at a very attractive price. Minor complaints aside, the NSP1 is a sweet little home-theater speaker package.--Wayne GarciaPros:Very fine soundExcellent component partsFlexible mounting optionsBroad warrantyCons:High frequencies lack refined detailLimited bass response",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31WEY4AVH5L._SX300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Home Audio,Stereo Components,Speakers,Speaker Systems,

Konica Z-Up 120VP Zoom 35mm Camera,"The Konica Z-Up 120 VP Zoom is an easy-to-use point-and-shoot camera with a built-in 38-120mm zoom lens. It comes loaded with a variety of automatic features but also allows for artistic control. It offers infrared nonscan active autofocus as well as macro and infinity focus modes for fuss-free clear shots at any distance. The Z-Up 120 also features a real-image viewfinder with autofocus framing and close-up compensation marks.The Konica Z-Up 120 VP is equipped for portraiture. It has a night-view portrait mode that lets the flash capture the subject in the foreground, while the slow shutter speed lets the magic of cityscape night views come shining through. An additional benefit for portrait lovers is the camera's red-eye reduction mode. By emitting a pre-flash beam of light, the subject's pupils contract, which helps minimize the red-eye effect. Other flash modes include autoflash, which detects when the light is dim; and flash off, for times when using a flash is inappropriate (such as in museums or during theater performances).An electronic 10-second self-timer gives you time to get into the picture, while electronic focus, loading, winding, and rewinding help shooters concentrate on composition instead of hassling with the technical aspects. The standard remote control allows the photographer to take pictures automatically from a distance. This camera also features date imprinting, so users will never have to guess when a shot was taken.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71XFQ8PYZTL._SX300_.gif,13.59,,Electronics,Camera & Photo,Film Photography,Film Cameras,Point & Shoot Film Cameras,

Grundig TR2PE Traveller II Shortwave Radio (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"No matter where you travel, Grundig's compact Traveller II PE world-band receiver keeps you entertained and feeling in touch. Even if you never leave home, this radio makes you feel like a globe hopper. Just spin the tuning dial of the Traveller II to bring in the news, culture, and personalities of the world.Grundig has been a leader in multiband radio technology for decades, and this radio does well by the brand, even though it's one of the German company's most basic and inexpensive models. To start with, you get two (12- or 24-hour) digital clocks--one to log home time and the other for world zones. While moving from one time zone to another, you can adjust the latter clock with the click of a dial that's hidden under the front cover. When home, it's useful to set the world clock for the 24-hour Greenwich (England) Mean Time zone; shortwave stations use this to fix their operations and promote upcoming shows. The home clock also functions as a sleep aid (with one-hour shutoff), or as an alarm, awakening with either beeps or a radio program.Although some people are put off by shortwave's tuning intricacies, if you can insert the batteries, flip a few switches, and twist a dial, you can be up and running in a few seconds with the Traveller II PE. For world-band novices, the slide-rule style analog tuner found on this model is actually preferable to the digital tuning mechanisms in more expensive multibands, which ask you to tap in a four- or five-digit station frequency (e.g., 4.950 or 11.650 MHz). In the shortwave world, some radio shows broadcast for just 15 to 60 minutes in a specific language (such as English), and frequency-sharing stations go on and off the air abruptly. So until you get your sea legs, it's easier to just ""go fishing"" across the dial, stopping when you get an audible bite and being prepared to move on at a moment's notice. It's also useful to know that shortwave programming and reception really picks up after dark, when those long-distance signals propagate best.From our East Coast locale in the U.S., we've been tuning in the likes of Spanish flamenco music from Madrid; BBC news from England; cabaret music and a special on philosopher Jean Paul Sartre from France; Canadian news and entertainment; classical music from Germany and Austria; Cuban jazz; ""Voice of America Now"" news; an RAI variety show from Italy; and lifestyle reports from Japan. The Traveller II PE has picked up all of these international stations with reasonable clarity and minimal fading.The Traveller II PE does a decent job at tuning in AM and FM channels, too, but be warned: the signal reach with these bands won't be any better than you'd get with a conventional portable, and the FM plays in mono only, not stereo.The small speaker puts out a limited-frequency sound, typical of pocket-sized transistor radios. Fortunately, the headphone jack delivers better quality sound when the earbuds are used.Overall, we found our world-radio expedition with the Traveller II to be quite satisfying--and there's no passport required.Pros:Good reception of many world stationsSmall size makes it a pleasure to packAttractive silver stylingDoubles as an alarm clockCons:Lo-fi listening through the speakerMonaural FM",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71GFDS14X5L._SX300_.gif,40.48,,Electronics,Portable Audio & Video,Radios,Shortwave Radios,,

JBL S412PBE Single Floorstanding Speaker (Beech) (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"The stately S412PBE floorstanding loudspeaker is the flagship model in JBL's Studio series (available inblackas well as beech). JBL arms this four-way, full-range speaker with a 12-inch, 200-watt powered woofer and dedicated LFE (Low Frequency Effects) input. This LFE input obviates the need for a separate subwoofer for home theater or music listening, especially with programs recorded in 5.1-channel surround formats, such as Dolby Digital and DTS. Remember, though--you'll need to plug the speaker into an AC outlet to appreciate the onboard amplification.The S412PBE also features a stunning 92 dB sensitivity for uncommonly loud, dynamic performance with almost any amplifier. Use two for stereo or up to five for multichannel applications (though center-channel placement would almost preclude the use of a television).Much of what you're paying for here is the powered-woofer component, which alone is worth its weight in bass-chuffing DVDs. However, the S412PBE also boasts myriad design benefits, including PolyPlas speaker cones, an Elliptical Oblate Spheroidal (EOS) waveguide, a Linear Field Proximity (LPF) bezel, Straight-line Signal Path (SSP) crossover networks, and a FreeFlow flared bass port.PolyPlas, a polymer-coated cellulose fiber, adds rigidity and damping to a cone without unduly increasing its mass. This cone, together with a durable rubber surround (the part of the cone that attaches to the rest of the speaker), enables the speaker to deliver high sound levels without breakup or distortion--and the S412PBE can play stunningly loud and distortion-free. If you're listening loud enough to distort this speaker, you should probably be more worried for your hearing than your stereo.The S412PBE's driver complement consists of three PolyPlas-cone drivers (with diameters of 12, 6, and 4 inches) and a 1-inch pure-titanium tweeter. All are magnetically shielded to prevent image distortion when you place them near a TV.The pure-titanium tweeter uses JBL's patented EOS waveguide to focus the sonic image and reduce time-delay artifacts. The EOS waveguide also increases the tweeter's dynamic range and its output at lower frequencies, which improves the transition between the high frequencies and the midrange. The LFP (Linear Field Proximity) bezel, which houses both the tweeter and the 4-inch midrange driver, smoothes out that transition even further. By minimizing the distance between these critical sound sources, JBL sidesteps the phase problems that result from sounds meeting your ears with different arrival times.JBL's custom-designed drivers allow it to use simple, Straight-line Signal Path (SSP) crossover networks with quality electrical components. These networks further smooth the speaker's frequency and power response while minimizing processing that could otherwise degrade your audio signal. JBL built the S412PBE's woofers into cast-aluminum frames, which--because of their solidity--reduce distortion and increase power-handling capability over stamped steel frames.On the inside, the drivers' oversized Kapton voice coils and HeatScape motor structures preserve performance accuracy during extended listening, prolong driver life, and reduce power compression through their responsiveness. Finally, JBL's FreeFlow flared bass port releases bass energy from behind the 12-inch woofer through a vent that precisely matches the size and configuration of the driver and speaker cabinet.The sound on this speaker is clear, detailed, and punchy. If you like to play your music and movies loud, this is the speaker for you. It sounds good at low levels, but we found that it sounded better the louder we cranked it--especially when we fed the speaker a low-frequency (subwoofer) output from our amplifier. For best results you'll want to listen no closer than 10 feet, on average; close listening tips the S412PBE's frequency balance too far to the bright side for our tastes.When it's positioned well, the S412PBE packs one heck of a wallop. The onboard amplifier deepens the bass response to an impressive 32 Hz, producing the cinematic low frequencies while freeing your surround receiver or amplifier from the intense demands of dynamic bass reproduction. The bass may not be quite as tight or well defined as in good sealed-enclosure speakers, but at this price we're not complaining.If your space and budget allow, the JBL S412PBE makes a stunning addition to any home theater or stereo system.Pros:Clear, powerful soundNatural frequency balancePlays very loud without distortionGreat bass responseCons:Bass not as tight as good sealed-enclosure speakers",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41E6HG9448L._SY300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Home Audio,Stereo Components,Speakers,Floorstanding Speakers,

RTV2020 ReplayTV Digital Video Recorder with Lifetime Subscription Service,"With Replay's 2020 personal television server, it's easy to watch whatever you want, whenever you want, with or without commercials. ReplayTV's 2020 server provides up to 20 hours of storage space and offers a host of upgrades, including an advanced programmable remote control with a new Replay Zones button that makes it very easy to find the shows you want to record.For those unfamiliar with the concept of television servers, ReplayTV records programs digitally and stores the information on a hard drive. Like a VCR, you can record your favorite show while you're away from home and watch it later. However, unlike VCRs, the personal TV server doesn't require tapes or other software to store programming.It's important to point out that the actual amount of storage space depends on the video-recording quality that you select. A higher-quality picture will take up more storage space than a lower-quality recording. At the lowest setting, the picture quality is still better than standard VHS. At the middle setting, the picture quality is better than an S-VHS VCR, but storage capacity decreases by approximately 40 percent. If you leave the 2020 at the middle setting, you can anticipate approximately 12 hours of storage space. The highest-quality setting approaches 500 lines of resolution (depending on the source), but further reduces storage capacity to about six hours of recording time. We recommend using the High Record Quality setting for movies and the middle level for sporting events and other programs, then erasing the content after watching it.One of the coolest features on the 2020 server is the ability to pause a live broadcast and resume watching it from where you left off. ReplayTV acts as a time buffer by storing the show in memory. A Return to Live button on the remote lets you skip forward to real time, which is great if you're watching a sporting event and want to catch up to the live action. There's also an Instant Replay button on the remote that allows you to rewatch portions of a show in 7-second increments, so you're not limited to rewatching only a brief segment.ReplayTV also allows you to personalize programming for a specific theme. For example, you can set ReplayTV to monitor TV listings and record programs featuring a specific actor. You can also refine theme-based searches for programming. For instance, if you wish to record the sitcom ""Friends,"" you can limit your search to title only, so ReplayTV won't pull up every movie and talk show that has the word ""friends"" in the description.ReplayTV's onscreen guide appears with a blue background and white characters that are very readable. Since you'll be using the guide a lot to search for programs and to preview descriptions, it's important that you can read the text on a standard-size TV from your sofa.We loved ReplayTV's Quick Skip feature, which allows you to instantly jump ahead 30 seconds, so you can skip through TV commercials on prerecorded programs. We also like the Replay Zones, which make it very easy to find programs that suit your tastes by searching according to genre. ReplayTV delineates programming into a wide variety of categories, from action and romance movies to cooking and home-improvement shows--and everything in between. ReplayTV also offers a Search Zone that allows you to input words such as ""love"" or ""vacation"" using the remote control and an onscreen keypad.If you wish to save a particular prerecorded show, you can record it onto a VCR using the back-panel outputs. We were impressed by ReplayTV's inclusion of two sets of audio-video inputs and outputs, as well as an S-video input and output. This enables users to hook up a DSS or other direct-broadcast satellite receiver to the 2020, along with a VCR as an output device.You can watch one program while recording another by using a cable TV splitter. Simply connect the cable from the wall to the splitter's input line; then connect a spare coaxial cable from the splitter's output line to the 2020, and another from the splitter to the TV. To watch a show while recording another, use the TV button on the Replay remote to switch sources (assuming you've input your TV brand's IR code into Replay's universal remote control).One neat feature we really like is the ability to place the 2020 into ""quiet mode,"" simply by turning off the unit. This keeps the server from automatically recording shows to the hard drive, which conserves power and keeps the hard disk from spinning. If you happen to be recording a show when you turn the 2020 off, it will continue to record, then shut down once the show is finished and stored in the hard drive.Connecting the 2020 to our home theater system took about 15 minutes. Replay Networks thoughtfully provides a poster-size chart to guide users through setup so they don't have to open the manual. If you have an open phone jack, we recommend using it. Otherwise, you can use the supplied splitter to connect the 2020 to an existing line. (You do not need a dedicated phone line, since ReplayTV's programming updates occur for only a few minutes in the early morning hours.) You can also purchase a 56K wireless transmitter/receiver, which plugs into a wall outlet and allows you to connect the 2020 to an existing phone line across the room or in another part of the house.Dialing into ReplayTV to download the free programming guide was much easier than we expected. In only 20 minutes, we received the weekly programming data and software updates from ReplayTV, and we were ready for couch potato duty. One major advantage to ReplayTV is that it doesn't charge any monthly service fee for program guide downloads.We like the fact that ReplayTV's service is nonintrusive. After all, the whole concept of personal TV servers is intended to liberate viewers, so they can watch the programs they prefer, whenever they feel like it. ReplayTV is designed to make it as easy as possible for customers to find the programs they like and to record them for future enjoyment.--Eric GillPros:Easy to navigate onscreen guideIntuitive remote controlFree programming guideCons:No internal fan to cool unitLimited to 20 hours of storage at low-quality record setting",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61N1D7N4BYL._SX300_.gif,,,Electronics,Television & Video,Streaming Media Players,,,

Philips HDR312 TiVo 30-Hour Digital Video Recorder,"Unlike analog VCRs, Philips's HDR312 personal TV receiver uses TiVo technology to store compressed audio-video data to a computer hard disk. When you're ready to watch a preselected program, the HDR312 retrieves it upon command from a list of shows you've recorded.Among the most revolutionary aspects of the Philips/TiVo server is the ability to pause live broadcasts and either resume a program where you left off or return to the program in real time. For example, while watching live sporting events, you can replay the last eight seconds of the action. You can then return to the live broadcast at any time. Using the palm-size remote, you can rewind and fast-forward pretaped programs, skipping through recorded commercials if you choose.Philips supplies all the necessary cables for setting up the HDR312, including a 50-foot phone line and splitter. You don't need a separate phone line; simply connect the splitter to the wall, connect your phone and receiver cable to the splitter, and you're in business. The phone line is vital, however, for downloading TV listings; recording shows; and receiving TiVo's Suggestions feature, which suggests programs you might enjoy based on your previous selections, andTiVolution Magazine, which offers recommendations on the best programs to watch. After the initial download, the receiver spends about five minutes updating your programming data each night.TiVo's onscreen setup guide includes easy step-by-step instructions. TiVo charges $12.95 a month for its weekly listing service,TiVolution Magazine, and its Suggestions feature, or you can pay a one-time service charge of $299.Once you've selected a program to record, you have four choices of picture quality: basic, medium, high, or best.

Harman Kardon AVR 7000 Dolby Digital/DTS Audio/Video Receiver (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"Heading up Harman Kardon's superb line of surround receivers is the flagship AVR 7000, which cranks out 100 quality watts to all five channels across the audible frequency spectrum. Harman Kardon, long a champion of the importance of high current over high power, offers both in this model: the AVR 7000 delivers a staggering 75 amps of High Current Capability (HCC) to drive the most demanding speaker loads without distortion.And while sound quality is definitely a priority here--we're talking about Harman Kardon, after all--a lot of circuit-design and digital signal processing know-how went into this receiver.Most significantly, the receiver offers Harman's exclusive Logic 7 and VMAx surround modes (intelligent 5.1- and two-channel surround matrices for any sound source--stereo or otherwise) and onboard decoding of Dolby Digital and DTS surround formats in addition to HDCD. Throw in 30 FM/AM station presets alongside S-video and component-video switching, and you're looking at your key to top-flight music and home-theater enjoyment for well under $2,000.The AVR 7000 can also supply sound for two rooms (with the use of an external infrared remote sensor), and the receiver comes with one set of stereo RCA outputs, composite- and S-video outputs, and a separate, limited-function remote control for this purpose.With all of its features, however, nothing gets in the way of sound performance. The tone controls--the AVR 7000 offers actual bass and treble knobs--can be taken out of the audio circuit to keep the audio signal path as short and clean as possible. In listening to CDs through either the analog or digital inputs, we found that the AVR 7000 opens a big, natural window on the music. (We recommend using your CD player's analog outputs only if it has no digital outputs or if it's a player with extremely high-quality analog circuitry.)With the AVR 7000, the qualities we expect from separates (preamplifier and amplifier components) but don't usually get from integrated receivers abound: a wonderful sense of air and ambiance; complex layers of rich harmonics; a beautiful nuance in vocal delivery; wide dynamics and subtle microdynamics; smooth, extended high frequencies; and a bottom end that is at once powerful and well defined but never muddy.Surround decoding of Dolby Digital- and DTS-encoded discs, performed by 24-bit, 96 kHz Crystal DSP (digital signal processing) circuits, is just as impressively clear and dynamic.The AVR 7000's biggest drawback is that you can't adjust the speaker delays for surround formats other than Dolby Digital. Because most living rooms do not lend themselves to optimal home-theater speaker placement, it's standard for receivers to let you input and store the distance (in either feet or meters) from your various speakers to your primary listening position. This ensures that the sounds from your speakers arrive at your ears simultaneously, as if you were equidistant from all speakers. You can, however, adjust the relative volume levels of each channel, which is actually more important than adjusting the delay times.In practice, the AVR 7000's surround sound coherence is excellent, even with DTS-encoded multichannel music CDs (though the presentation in one of our less ideal rooms was not as seamless as it might have been).The AVR 7000 also lets you toggle between a given component's analog and digital outputs from the remote control--a function that few receivers offer. Granted, this feature will appeal mainly to audiophiles who are interested in comparing, for instance, the sound of a component's analog outputs to its digital output, or the effect that different analog audio interconnects have on the sound (using the digital output as a reference). But Harman excels in this kind of detail-oriented feature, and it's good to know it's available here.Unlike most of the overhyped proprietary DSP modes out there, Harman Kardon's own Logic 7 (multichannel) and VMAx (two-channel) surround modes work extremely well, in most cases audibly improving over regularly decoded, discrete source material (like Dolby Digital and DTS)--no small feat. Logic 7 also instantaneously generates 5.1-channel information from two-channel material such as CDs, television, VHS tapes, and other sources, letting you take full advantage of your surround system without the annoying artifacts that often accompany such faux-surround algorithms.Setting up the AVR 7000 is, not surprisingly, a complex and time-consuming effort, but one that pays off. To its credit, the unit boasts a terrific onscreen setup display (though it does reset your settings when you revisit a given parameter), one of the best owner's manuals we've seen, and an uncluttered, illuminated, full-function remote control capable of operating up to eight devices (choose from 17 brands of DVD players and over 80 brands of televisions).The only other drawback worth mentioning is that the system often takes a few seconds to lock onto a new sound format, whether it's DTS or an HDCD-encoded CD. This means that you'll occasionally miss the first couple seconds of sound, but you can always preselect the format or simply start the track anew. This was not an issue in DVD video titles, where the surround format is usually triggered long before you actually need to hear sound.When it's all configured and set to go, you'll have most of the home theater world at your remote-clicking fingertips, from full future-ready capabilities in the receiver's 5.1-channel analog inputs (perfect for DVD audio) to component-video switching for videophile DVD video performance.If you're hankering for top-of-the-line audio performance and highest-level video switching, the AVR 7000 is a real bargain.--Michael MikesellPros:Sound quality rivals separatesExcellent build qualityLoaded with featuresConverts S-video to composite-videoRemote control lets you toggle between analog and digital inputs for a given componentControls easy to navigateDefeatable tone controlsFuture ready with 5.1-channel analog inputsCons:Lengthy setup procedureNo speaker-delay settings for DTS surround soundNo phono inputSystem can take a few seconds to catch up with a new sound source",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41BRYS92ZVL._SX300_.jpg,9.99,,Electronics,Home Audio,Stereo Components,Receivers & Amplifiers,Component Receivers,

Harman Kardon AVR 500 Dolby Digital/DTS Audio/Video Receiver (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"Harman Kardon's AVR 500 is a shining example of a fine audio-video (AV) receiver with superb sound. In addition to standard Dolby Pro Logic and Dolby Digital surround decoding, the AVR 500 also comes with built-in DTS (Digital Theater Sound) decoding as well as Harman Kardon's proprietary Logic 7 and VMAx surround modes. Most importantly, though, the AVR 500 is simply a superb sounding receiver.For example, with CDs the AVR 500 presents a big, natural window on the music. The qualities we expect from separates (preamplifier and amplifier components) but don't usually get from integrated receivers abound here: a wonderful sense of air and ambiance; complex layers of rich harmonics; a beautiful nuance in vocal delivery; wide dynamics and subtle microdynamics; smooth, extended high frequencies; and a bottom end that is at once powerful and well defined and never muddy.Surround decoding of Dolby Digital- and DTS-encoded discs, performed by 24-bit, 96-kHz Crystal DSP (digital signal processing) circuits, is just as impressive. The AVR 500 creates one of the most convincing and enveloping soundscapes we've heard from a receiver, rivaling the performance of many fine (and pricey) configurations of separates.Unlike most of the overhyped proprietary DSP modes out there, Harman Kardon's own Logic 7 (multichannel) and VMAx (two-channel) surround modes work extremely well, in most cases audibly improving regularly decoded, discrete source material (such as Dolby Digital and DTS)--which is no small feat.

Harman Kardon AVR 300 Dolby Digital/DTS Audio/Video Receiver (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"The AVR 300 is Harman Kardon's most affordable full-featured receiver--it combines Dolby Pro Logic, Dolby Digital, and DTS surround decoding and provides S-video switching, a full complement of preamp outputs, and 5.1-channel direct inputs. But there's more than features here: the AVR 300 exhibits Harman Kardon's unswerving attention to sonic accuracy and detail.Because of its sophistication, the AVR 300 does require some effort to set up. Thankfully, Harman Kardon's owner manuals are among the most clearly written and illustrated that we've seen. Additionally, the AVR 300's intuitive onscreen display and uncluttered, programmable remote control speed the setup considerably. Our only wish is that the universal remote was fully illuminated; the only the buttons that glow are the ones you're commanding at the moment.The AVR 300's performance, however, is outstanding. Stereo recordings sound full and natural. This receiver offers a terrific sense of air with pinpoint placement of sonic images in the stereo sound field. Dynamics are well above average, thanks to Harman's High-Current Capability. High frequencies are silky smooth and the bass scores points for both definition and wallop.Surround sources, whether Dolby Digital or DTS, are equally satisfying, enveloping you in a wide and seamless sonic environment that makes great surround-mixed music and movies much more compelling.And if you've any reservations about the seemingly low 50-watt-per-channel power rating, surrender them now--the AVR 300's high-quality amplifier has power to spare, even with demanding source material.It's very simple: if you want one of the best sounding, most generously endowed receivers on the market and are willing to pay just a bit more than the average, then Harman Kardon's AVR 300 must be in the running; the returns on your investment will be anything but average.Pros:Superb sound qualityExcellent build qualityLoaded with featuresGreat valueCons:Remote is not fully illuminated",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41BDT5AEKHL._SX300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Home Audio,Stereo Components,Receivers & Amplifiers,Component Receivers,

Iomega 10918 Zip 250 MB Parallel Port,"Remember when floppy drives ruled the land of backup storage? With hard drives becoming ever more cavernous and file sizes becoming more bloated each year, it's a wonder those atrociously slow floppy drives still come standard on every computer. Maybe it's time you moved up to something faster, better, and more capacious. A Zip 100, you say? Maybe last year. But why bother with that when you can get a Zip 250?As you likely have gathered from the name, Iomega's Zip 250 uses 250 MB disks for incremental data backup. Since the media is removable, you can buy new disks when you need more storage instead of buying an entirely new drive. The 250 MB capacity is a much more reasonable standard for shuttling around files than the 1.44 MB diskettes used by a typical floppy drive.You might be worried about purchasing a drive that uses a parallel interface, as that's the port most printers occupy. Iomega thoughtfully has designed the Zip 250 with a pass-through port, meaning you can attach the drive to the PC and then attach a printer to the Zip drive. It worked flawlessly in our tests. The drive comes with both an AC adapter and a parallel cable, along with one 250 MB Zip disk--everything you need to get started.Zip drives always have been designed well, and the Zip 250 is exceptional in this regard. There's a well on the side for the power plug so it doesn't protrude from the jack. This makes it possible to stand the drive on its side if it's taking up too much space lying flat.Zip products have been around long enough that the software for them has had plenty of time to mature. The included CD-ROMs contain useful tools like Copy Machine, which lets you copy a Zip disk using a single Zip drive, and a one-step backup/restore utility, which easily backs up files from your hard drive. We also liked the included Norton Zip Rescue Disaster Recovery software, which lets you make a working backup copy of your Windows installation so you can easily restore it if the system goes bad. It works much better than the Startup Disk utility included with Windows 95 and Windows 98.The main drawback to the parallel-port Zip 250 is its abysmal transfer rate. Peaking at 0.8 MB per second, we're talking at least five minutes for a 250 MB transfer. That's under perfect circumstances, and we all know how often computer users encounter perfect circumstances. Regardless, it's better than the 1.44 MB floppy drive it replaces, and most users won't need to transfer more than a few megabytes worth of data at a time.--T.

Of course, PC users can take advantage of the significant performance and capacity benefits of the SCSI Zip 250 drive with the addition of a Zip Zoom SCSI accelerator card or other ASPI compatible SCSI card.Zip drives answer the call for your demanding storage needs such as downloading software, images, and information from the Internet, or delivering your latest brochure or artwork to a pre-press service bureau.

"Monster Cable MP CG500 Monster Power Computer PowerCenter CG500 500 VA , 8 outlet UPS","Home Office Will Never Be the Same Battery backup is critical to any home office because of the potential of valuable data loss or corruption during a blackout or brownout. During sudden power outages, a hard disk crash can even occur, causing hours of aggravation in recovering data. Typical UPS backup systems allow only a minimal amount of backup time, and sometimes don't react fast enough to prevent data loss, depending on response time. The loss of even a precious few milliseconds of backup time can result in data loss and hard disk crashes. But power failures are not the only power problems encountered by a computer that can cause data loss. Momentary spikes and surges can overload computer circuitry and cause serious damage to hardware and data. Today's home office needs both uninterruptible power and full surge protection to be completely safe. Introducing Monster's High Performance PowerCenter  CG500: More Than Just a UPS. The CG500 is the only high performance all-in-one power solution for your entire computer system. Packed full of performance and convenience features, CG500 is a full capacity surge protector and UPS for the price of one. Monster's advanced CrashGuard  circuitry features a sophisticated microprocessor for total power management and maximum battery life. CrashGuard's ultra-quick response time (less than 4 milliseconds) enables CG500 to battery power your system the instant a power disturbance occurs, for up to 20 minutes of backup time. This will give you ample time to save active data and safely shut down your computer system. CG500's ultra-high 500 VA rating provides the maximum current needed to support powerful computer systems with large, high-resolution monitors during power outages. Unlike other UPS devices, CG500's full capacity SurgeGuard  circuitry provides an ultra-high 1665 joule rating for maximum protection against surge and spike damage. This protection extends to your modem and network connections as well, protecting your entire computer system. Emergency KickStart : When Everything Else Fails: In case of an emergency, when all power fails, you may have to access important computer data or internet/e-mail connections. But if your computer is not turned on, even a UPS won't help. Advanced KickStart circuitry lets you operate CG500 to power your computer when AC power has failed, and even if the CG500 is initially turned off, so you can contact emergency services, friends and relatives, and access important data off the Internet. Monster's CG500 Makes Life Easier: Color-Coded, Labeled Outlets So You Don't, OOPS.... Unplug the Wrong Thing. Monster recognizes that convenience is on par with performance. After all, most of us have reached to unplug something in the deep and dark cave behind the computer system and randomly started pulling plugs. Sooner or later, most of us unplug something we don't want to - like the CPU - which can cause data corruption and hard disk crashes. With Monster's unique color-coding system, you'll always know which components are plugged in where. Color-coding assigns each product its own outlet and a matching AC cord label for easy identification when unplugging components. 8 Outlets Instead of 6: Many UPS devices on the market do not supply enough outlets for a full home office, so you need to add more outlets and surge protectors, cluttering up your neat, organized home office. By providing eight outlets, we take care of all of your home office AC power needs, while helping to keep your office clean and neat. PowerCharge  Quick Recharge Circuit: Should you experience power failure, our innovative Monster PowerCharge  enables you to recharge Monster's powerful 7,000mAH battery in less than four hours. And, unlike many UPS devices which use ""sealed"" batteries that can't be replaced, Monster's user replaceable battery eliminates the cost and hassle of buying a new UPS simply because the battery wears out.

The Monster Satellite&#8482; High Performance Satellite Receiver Connection Kit contains advanced audio and composite (RCA) video cables that bring out excellent sound and picture from your digital satellite system investment.HIGH RESOLUTION VIDEOThere are a lot of poor quality video cables out there that transfer video signals improperly - resulting in an inferior picture. RF-type cable with F-pin connectors offers the least performance benefit because it can interact with RF signals from TV, FM radio, and fluorescent lights to seriously degrade sound and picture quality. Plus, the RF connection can only deliver mono audio. Conventional composite video cables often use ordinary constructions that cause signal loss and low conductivity, especially over long runs. All you see is poor reproduction of video source material, a fuzzy picture, and inaccurate color rendition. And most are not properly shielded to reject EMI and RF interference that causes a snowy picture. Unlike these video cable constructions, Monster Video 2 (MV2) advanced technology incorporates a specially stranded, all copper design for lower signal loss and reduction in ""video noise."" Special heavy-duty double shielding protects MV2 against outside EMI and RF interference for a digital satellite system picture with sharp, detailed image and bright, vivid, more natural color rendition.THE SOUND FACTORUnlike standard coaxial or conventional audio cables that often distort sound and restrict dynamic range, Interlink 250 balanced audio interconnect cable delivers fuller, more natural music reproduction. Its two balanced copper conductors provide smoother sound. A 100% foil shield rejects EMI and RF interference that cause noise such as buzz and hum. And each conductor is surrounded by low-loss dielectrics for minimum signal loss and accurate reproduction, even over long runs.A MONSTEROUS CONNECTIONMonster's audio and video cables are terminated with our precision-machined 24k gold plated RCA connectors for a reliable connection and strong signal transfer.SIT BACK AND ENJOYMonster Cable's high performance audio and video cables deliver all the sound and picture from your digital satellite system for maximum enjoyment of satellite programming.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5146RSF706L._SX300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Accessories & Supplies,Audio & Video Accessories,Cables & Interconnects,Audio Cables,RCA Cables

Monster Cable Home Theatre Reference PowerCenter Surge Protection (MP HTS2000) (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"""Polluted"" AC power can degrade the audiophile performance you expect from your home theatre components.Unless you live directly behind Hoover Dam, your AC power is most likely ""polluted"" by appliances sharing the same power line with your home theatre components.  Electrical power tools, refrigerators, air conditioners, radio transmitter, cellular phones, microwave ovens, even your neighbor's freezer, all generate electromagnetic interference and radio frequency noise which pollutes the AC power and degrades audio and video performance.  Even your other home theatre components generate noise interference-adding more ""pollution"" to your AC power.  As a result, you'll hear a loss of dynamic range and resolution with a compressed soundstage and imprecise imaging.  You'll see less color detail and sharpness in your TV picture quality.  And you'll never  know how much of the essential drama is gone in the high performance picture and sound your home theatre was designed to deliver.Monster's Clean Power Circuitry filters ""pollution"" on the AC power for improved sonic performance and picture resolution.Designed by world renown AC power expert Richard Marsh, Monster's Clean Power Circuitry employs special non-resonant filters to reduce RF, EMI and other distortions on your AC power line.  The results give you dramatic improvements in sonic performance and picture resolution.  Your music and sound will seem to emerge from a ""blacker"" background, rather than a ""gray area.""  Midrange textures become more liquid and balanced.  A sweeter and brighter treble sweeps the high end without harshness or a metallic character.  Soundstaging improves with greater transparency, tighter image focus and a well-rendered soundstage depth.  Your picture resolution will be sharper with less color shift.  In the end, you'll get all the performances you paid for...and isn't that what it's all about?Monster PowerCenters make life easier.Monster makes the management of all your power connections easier with color-coded outlets and corresponding cord labels.  And finally, Monster gives you a generous eight foot current capacity power cord which is the optimum length to reach most AC power outlets.Maximize your system's performance and protection.Enhanced system performance with component-specific power filtering...protection from polluted AC power, surges, spikes and inconvenience!  Monster's Home Theatre PowerCenters meet the high performance demands of today's discriminating audiophile.Multiple SurgeGuard Protects Components From Harmful surges and SpikesHarmful power surges and voltage spikes can travel up the AC power line and damage connected equipment.  Lightening, automatic garage doors, power tools, refrigerators and fluorescent lights all cause power surges and voltage spikes that affect phone lines and coax cables.  Monster's Multiple SurgeGuard detects harmful power surges and voltage spikes before they reach components.This PowerCenter HTS 2000 features special surge protection for phone lines and coax cables used for DSS, DIVX /DVD and cable TV connections.  Other surge protectors can result in as much as 20 to 30dB of signal loss, which ultimately affects the output performance of coax connections.

Viking 16 MB CompactFlash Card (CF16M),"Go to the Memory Finder tosee a listingof the digital cameras, PDAs, MP3 players, photo printers, or other products that are guaranteed compatible with this Viking product. TheMemory Findercontains an up-to-date list of the devices that work with this memory.Benefits of Adding Flash MemoryIncreased Speed: With a larger flash card you will spend less time transferring files to or from your computer or laptop and more time taking pictures with your digital camera, listening to music on your digital audio player, or storing more information on your PDA.Increased Power: Increasing the memory storage for your digital camera, PDA, or MP3 player will enable you to do more with a device. For example, if you are taking pictures on your digital camera using the highest resolution and highest quality setting, an image taken from a 2-megapixel camera can be as large as 6 MB. This can eat up storage space quickly, so it's easy to see the benefits of increasing your device's flash memory.Guaranteed CompatibilityIt is important to purchase memory that is guaranteed to be compatible with a device because of the many subtle differences between the hundreds of different brands, types, and configurations of digital devices on the market. A product that accepts one particular brand or capacity of memory does not necessarily accept another brand or capacity--and there's nothing more frustrating than buying something you can't use.Because compatibility is so critically important, Amazon has forged a strategic relationship with Viking Components to create the Memory Finder. TheMemory Finderis a tool that can help you find memory that works with your specific product, taking the guesswork out of buying memory.Quality ProductsViking Components physically tests their flash cards with hundreds of devices including laptops, PDAs, digital audio players, and digital cameras.

Sharp DV-L70U 7&quot; Portable DVD Player,"Give Sharp's new portable DVD player some bonus frequent flyer miles, book a flight to anywhere and watch this Moviegoer soar. The DV-L70U is ideal for long airline flights, since you can play both DVDs and music CDs--for free! It's also a great pacifier for anxious kids on highway journeys.About the size of two DVD cases stacked on top of one another, the DV-L70U Moviegoer weighs just over two pounds with the supplied lithium battery pack, making it lighter than competing models. With a 7-inch diagonal, 16:9 aspect-ratio screen, the Moviegoer also offers one of the largest portable DVD pictures currently available.The L70U's liquid crystal display is extremely impressive; it offers good brightness and contrast levels (even in high-ambient light) and we found absolutely no anomalies such as dead pixels. The DV-L70U exhibited a minimal amount of hotspotting--a common problem with LCD technology, where the lower-middle portion of the screen appears washed out. Although some grays appear slightly blue, colors remain faithful overall; flesh tones and outdoor scenes look natural instead of pink and neon green. In fact, the Moviegoer's vivid images seem to expand the 7-inch diagonal screen size instead of diminishing it.The rechargeable lithium battery pack snaps into place and connects to the player via a short, pin-connector cable. An onscreen icon flashes when the battery is low. Sharp estimates the battery will last for up to three hours before it needs recharging. With the supplied AC adapter, you can recharge the unit in about five hours. The AC adapter allows you to play movies on the DV-L70U, which is useful if you want to watch DVDs in a hotel room. You can also connect the DV-L70U to a TV monitor and use it as a standalone DVD player.Sharp supplies all the necessary audio-video (AV) cables, except the digital-audio optical link that's necessary to connect the DV-L70U to an outboard processor with DTS or Dolby Digital decoding. You can use the AV jacks for outputting and inputting audio-video signals. This enables you to use the LCD screen as a monitor to display images from a camcorder--or even a VCR.The layout of the DV-L70U's features is very intuitive; its basic functions--play, stop, skip, and arrow buttons for navigating DVD menus--reside on top of the panel to the right of the disc-loading well. You can access additional functions, such as zoom, virtual sound, subtitle on/off, as well as disc programming features, from the supplied remote control. You can also get to basic features from an onscreen graphical user interface (GUI), but we found the GUI to be more cumbersome than the remote or panel buttons.Our only other minor complaint concerns the Moviegoer's aesthetics. Although the faux brushed-aluminum design is very appealing, it reflects light back onto the LCD screen, particularly in the dark, which diminishes picture quality. We'd prefer a flat-black coating on the inside of the player.Soundwise, the dual front speakers below the screen are merely adequate. However, since portable DVD players lend themselves to solitary viewing, most users will use headphones. We recommend that you purchase a high-quality set. We also strongly recommend that you purchase a carrying case, given the cost and delicacy of the liquid crystal display.With an excellent set of headphones, a comfortable seat, and low ambient light, you may find yourself glued to the beautiful 7-inch LCD screen of Sharp's DV-L70U Moviegoer DVD player.--Eric GillPros:Very impressive picture qualityExtremely compact and lightweightAutomatic anti-skip bufferDoubles as a stand-alone DVD playerCons:Brushed-aluminum design reflects light onto screenMediocre sound quality from built-in speakers",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q4N16QARL._SX300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Television & Video,DVD Players & Recorders,DVD Players,,

Cerwin-Vega VS-100B Single Floorstanding Speaker (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"Well, now it can actually sound just like THIS.  It's a digital thing. A lot of today's music is played through sound-stretching digital processors (like synthesizers). Then it's recorded, mixed, and mastered. Digitally, to e xpand the dynamic range. Finally, this music shows up in your house as a digital disc you access with a laser beam. Do you really think your old speakers are up to it?Enter Cerwin-Vega VS Loudspeakers. VS? It stands for Velocity Sensitive. And it means you'll hear every detail in today's music. From a subtle whisper to a sudden CRASH! As well as all the note-bending digitalia in between. This, is a speed thing.A Velocity Sensitive loudspeaker has very fast ""transient response"".You see, the faster a speaker can respond to the myriad dynamic changes in musical energy, the more accurate the reproduction.There's no one particular key to fast transient response, but there is a combination. Our high energy magnet and voice coil assemblies work in swift precision with refined curvilinear cones, well-damped surrounds, and lightweight die-cast aluminum frames.>p? For starters, you can feel it in the bass. The 15"" woofer in our VS-150 can take low frequency response clear down to 28 Hertz. While handling up to 400 watts of power. To be honest, this kind of low bass is the result of gaping holes in design. We've cut dual vents in the rear panels of our VS-120 and VS-150 speakers to reduce port compression and increase bass output.What's more, our woofers are acoustically loaded (not unlike the musicians), such that the speaker is in perfect balance with the cabinet volume, as well as the port size. And Velocity Sensitive woofer cones have an improved stiffness to mass ratio. Meaning, they're light and at the same time, durable.Our new dividing network is the result of our undivided attention. Cerwin-Vega ""smart crossover circuitry"" is computer optimized. So it instantaneously routes frequencies to the appropriately matched driver.Smoothly (so you'll benefit from seamless driver integration), and quietly (our crossovers are acoustically transparent, and won't interfere with accurate frequency reproduction).Enough quiet time, let's get vocal here. Our large diameter midranges (6 1/2"" in the VS-150) will give you accurate vocal reproduction and great stereo imaging. Vibrant with clarity and presence.Our tweeter family consists of three polycarbonate models (in the VS-80, VS-100, and VS-120) and a polyimide soft dome in the VS-150. As if that's not technical enough for you, we call them ""balanced drive hybrid dome tweeters"". You get all the benefits of a pure dome tweeter, like good off-axis response and stable imaging, along with high power handling and sensitivity. In fact, our 1"" tweeter can make Madam Butterfly literally soar. To an audio altitude of 22,000 Hertz.All this high technology is protected by our Positive Temperature Coefficient Device (aka PTC). This is your internal tweeter insurance policy. What's more, we've built in overall fuse protection for the VS-120 and VS-150. Better music through science. And carpentry. Our cabinets are internally braced to minimize cabinet vibrations. And maximize bass. As well as the life expectancy of our already beefy 3/4"" composite board cabinets.To that end, every VS loudspeaker is wrapped in a black ash or walnut finish. And backed by a single sheet of paper. Our five year warranty. Meaning every time you sit down in front of a pair of VS speakers, there'll be someone standing behind them.From a company that, for over 45 years, has stood for integrity and quality.And lots of long advertising copy.Thanks very much for reading this far. It can be more than a little tough on the eyes. Our solution?Do something nice for your ears. Listen to a pair of VS loudspeakers. There's all kinds of great music out there.FeaturesFrequency Response - 37 Hz - 20 kHzPower Handling - 5 - 125 wattsSpeaker type - 3 way",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/310BZSTTDML._SY300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Home Audio,Stereo Components,Speakers,Floorstanding Speakers,

As with all Cerwin-Vega home theater speakers, the E-76C is also magnetically shielded, so you can place it above or below the TV without distorting the video image.

This allows you to navigate back to this point any time you want, from any location or, with Garmin's TracBack feature, you can reverse your track log and navigate your way back home. And once you start moving, the GPS provides other data, like speed, direction of movement, time and distance to destination, and more.In addition to these basic features, the eTrex provides one more critical benefit;peace of mind, because with GPS you know where you are, where you've been, and where you are going.

Sony DCRTRV110P Handycam Digital Camcorder,"The Sony DCR-TRV110P Handycam provides top-of-the-line digital recording with a host of advanced options. Its powerful 360x digital zoom, wide range of special effects, image stabilization, and Sony's unique infrared night recording capabilities make it a great choice for those needing high-end digital camcorder features. Sony's elongated Handycam design fits easily in one hand and is well-balanced. While not the lightest of camcorders, we found the Handycam line to be one of the most ergonomic and easy to use.The Sony DCR-TRV110P Handycam has a nifty status screen on the outside of the LCD screen module that lets you know how many minutes you've recorded or how far you've played a tape. It also tells you if there's a tape in the camcorder. This screen is backlit for maximum visibility.The LCD screen swivels 210 degrees, which lets you record above your head or put yourself in the picture. The optical viewfinder is black and white, which is not a realdrawback since we ended up using the LCD screen for most of our shooting. The unit's playback buttons are backlit, making it easier to use the Sony DCR-TRV110P Handycam as a VCR. This video camera also comes with a remote control unit.The Sony DCR-TRV110P Handycam lets you manually adjust focus and exposure; it also includes seven programmed exposure modes, plus backlight compensation, to help optimize your video under different shooting conditions. The Sony DCR-TRV110P provides three recording modes--normal, hold-down, and five-second--to help you take short, lively video segments. You can also record still photos. The high-powered 360x digital zoom is great for getting closeups and recording faraway events, and a built-in electronic image stabilizer helps prevent camera shake--especially useful when using the zoom or during fast-action events.We enjoyed Sony's full range of special effects, including the distinctive pastel, slim, and stretch picture modes. The DCR-TRV110P provides widescreen, black-and-white, sepia, negative, and solarized modes. We also liked the range of fade options, which include fade to black, mosaic, monotone, overlap, and a bounce-image effect. The video camera includes digital effects for playback, including still, flash, lumi, slow shutter, old movie, and trail modes. You can even insert a scene in the middle of a recording.The camcorder includes Sony's exclusive NightShot capability, which lets you shoot video in total darkness. The Handycam emits an invisible infrared beam to light the scene. The resulting video is basically black and white, and lower quality than normal, but being able to get decent images in complete darkness is nonetheless pretty amazing. The DCR-TRV110P comes with a mount for an external standard light.This camcorder uses the Digital 8 format, which lets you record digital video on a standard Hi8 tape. Digital video gives you extraordinary video quality--up to 500 lines of resolution and CD-quality sound; it's the top-of-the-line format. The digital format allows you to take digital still pictures, just like a digital camera. If you want to download and edit your digital still images and video on a computer, however, you have to purchase a separate video capture card first. You can also use this camcorder to play back analog 8mm and Hi8 tapes--a handy feature if you have previously recorded video in these formats.Pros:Super-powerful zoomStill photo capabilityHigh-quality digital formatGreat selection of special effectsImage stabilizationCons:Optical viewfinder is black and white",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/81K82XCN7KL._SX300_.gif,,,Electronics,Camera & Photo,Video,Camcorders,,

Other features include integrated S3 texture compression (S3TC), true hardware-accelerated DVD video playback, and TV output for high-quality, full-screen games or DVD (MPEG-2) movie titles.With so many games set to use multitexturing, and four picture elements per pixel becoming a standard, Viper II is the first graphics accelerator equipped to composite complex visual effects such as shadows, reflections, and bump and lighting maps in one cycle. Its hardware-integrated S3TC engine is a major leap forward for PC gaming technology as it enables games to use up to six times the number of textures found in today's games without affecting performance.The S3/Diamond Z200 Viper II 3D Graphics Card comes with a five-year product warranty, technical support six days a week by phone, and a 24-hour Internet tech-support wizard.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51T7KK00V4L._SX300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Computers & Accessories,Computer Components,Graphics Cards,,

Toshiba SD-1200 DVD Player,"Straight from the box, Toshiba's SD-1200 DVD player appears to be a lightweight machine--but appearances are deceiving. After plugging it in and letting it spin, we were overwhelmed by this player's audio-video performance.Although it weighs only 6.5 pounds, the SD-1200 reflects Toshiba's proven track record for building high-quality video components. This is a solid DVD player with sturdy rear-panel inputs and outputs. The SD-1200 provides only a single coaxial digital output and a pair of standard RCA analog-audio outputs (There is no optical digital-audio output.) Although we'd rather see both optical and coaxial, our preference for coaxial digital cables makes it easier to ignore the absence of the optical output--especially since optical connectors have a tendency to pull loose.The SD-1200's back panel accommodates composite- and S-video cables. Toshiba, which has been at the forefront of promoting component video, also offers ColorStream component jacks. Hooking the SD-1200 DVD player up to a TV with component-video inputs should render a decidedly superior picture, with more natural colors and less video noise. We used the SD-1200's S-video output, however, and saw no compromise in color fidelity. Edges were especially well defined, adding depth to the picture on our 54-inch rear-projection television. Toshiba offers a video black-level enhancement mode that you can access from the onscreen menu. Although it's designed to increase contrast and edge definition, we noticed little improvement with the enhancement; however, we didn't see any degradation either.Like most DVD players on the market today, the SD-1200 accommodates Dolby Digital as well as Digital Theater Sound (DTS). Unlike some of the low-end models we've tested, however, the SD-1200 performed flawlessly in both DTS and Dolby Digital. We fed the SD-1200 a hefty stream of DTS-encoded movies, surround-sound concert videos, and demo discs, and the player never missed a beat. Our concert videos sounded superb in 5.1-channel surround sound, and the thundering bass and crackling explosions in our action movies portrayed a realism unmatched by lesser DVD players.For the sake of simplicity, Toshiba opted for a minimalist front-panel design on the SD-1200--but to a fault, as this leaves all but the most basic functions up to the remote control. Although less is certainly more when it comes to front-panel buttons, we would at least like to be able to access the onscreen menu from the player in case the remote is lost or rendered inoperable.The remote is a pleasure to use, and while the buttons may prove too tiny for large fingers, we like the layout. Left/Right and Up/Down buttons are centrally placed, with the Enter button in the middle. The Open/Close and Power buttons are at the very top, where they belong.If you don't like the distraction of LED lights, you'll be happy to know that the SD-1200 allows you to dim or deactivate the panel display. You'll also like the onscreen bit-rate meter, which allows you to gauge the video bit-rate allocation at any given second while you're watching a DVD. The bit-rate bar fluctuates from less than 1 to 10, depending on the complexity of a given scene, with action sequences generally measuring between 8 and 9.5. This isn't a feature you'll want to leave on while you're enjoying a movie, but it's cool and thoughtful, and is the icing on the cake for this DVD player.Performance-wise, the SD-1200 is one of the best DVD-video players we've tested in its price range.--Eric GillPros:Good build qualityEasy to useExcellent sound qualityCons:No optical digital-audio outputNo front-panel menu access button",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31S6D033AZL._SX300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Television & Video,DVD Players & Recorders,DVD Players,,

Olympus D-360L 1.3 MP Digital Camera,"The Olympus D-360L digital camera offers truly outstanding performance for its price range. It's very similar to its bestselling predecessor, the Olympus D-340R, and, like all the Olympus cameras in this line, the D-360L produces high-quality photos with amazingly accurate color. This camera also works well in low-light situations and offers a wide array of compression, display, and printing options, making it a good choice for both beginners and advanced users.With an interface much like a standard point-and-shoot camera, the Olympus D-360L combines ease of use with digital technology, 2x digital zoom, and TTL autofocus with macro mode; these elements give you the flexibility to shoot a wide variety of subjects. The 1.3-megapixel CCD sensor ensures accurate color, while features such as automatic exposure, white balance, and four-mode flash enable you to capture shots in a range of lighting situations.The Olympus D-360L includes a 1.8-inch color TFT LCD monitor for picture composition and playback, onscreen menus, and on-the-spot lock/erase buttons so you don't lose pictures you want or waste memory. It also includes a 12-second self-timer, video-out capability, and optional direct printing straight from the camera. The camera automatically shuts off when not in use to preserve battery life.The Olympus D-360L is easy to set up; all you have to do is put in the batteries and memory card. The included 8 MB memory card holds up to 60 pictures in the lowest resolution mode (640 x 480), and memory is expandable up to 16 MB. Taking pictures is a snap; you can easily adjust the exposure, change the flash mode, change the picture compression mode, and use the self-timer. We ended up referring to the manual to display and erase pictures, but once we learned the process, it was simple to display images in either thumbnail or single-picture mode. The LCD screen is clear and bright, and we preferred using it instead of the optical viewfinder. The D-360L does well in low light, focusing in dark situations and then providing well-lighted images via the flash (which has a red-eye reduction option). As long as you have something stable to set the camera on, the D-360L takes great night cityscapes or indoor nonflash photos.The Olympus D-360L's strength lies partly in its high resolution--at 1,280 x 960, it's one of the highest-resolution digital cameras available for under $400. If you want the very highest picture quality, the D-360L can even record images as uncompressed TIFF files, eliminating any loss in quality suffered during compression. You can fit only two uncompressed images on an 8 MB memory card, but for certain high-end or professional applications, the uncompressed TIFF capability is a strong advantage.The only drawback to the D-360L is its relatively short battery life. Four AAs have enough power for only about 60 low-resolution pictures--not nearly enough for a day on the town or a friend's birthday party. It doesn't come with rechargeable batteries, but you should consider buying a few sets and a charger.Along with the Olympus D-360L, you receive a removable 8 MB SmartMedia card, capable of holding 122 standard quality shots, a Windows connectivity kit, a video output cable, four AA alkaline batteries, a user's guide, and a strap. You also get a CD-ROM with Camedia utility software for editing, manipulation, and panorama stitching. This camera is compatible with both Windows and Macintosh platforms and comes with a limited one-year warranty.--Cintra Pollack and Holly BlumenthalPros:Bright, clear LCD viewfinderHigh resolutionProvides uncompressed TIFF recording capabilitiesCompact sizeDoes well in low lightCons:Limited battery life",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41P74VM1KZL._SX300_.jpg,7.49,,Electronics,Camera & Photo,Digital Cameras,Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,,
Panasonic DVD-H1000 DVD Player,"The Panasonic DVD-H1000 DVD Player boasts a set of advanced features for the true audiophile or videophile. It offers a progressive video processor that converts film source signals to 480P output for reproduction of information that's more faithful to the original film. It can also convert interlaced to progressive scanning for an exceptionally accurate 480P signal. A 10-bit 4:4:4 signal processor converts recorded luminance and color-difference signals from 8 to 10 bits and ""upsamples"" color-signal data. Adjustable gamma allows you to choose from three different gamma settings to bring out detail in dark scenes. Even though the DVD-H1000 outputs a 480P signal formatted for 16:9 widescreen viewing, it can correctly display a 4:3 image on a 16:9 screen using the original scaling algorithm of a DVD disc designed for 4:3 viewing.The Panasonic DVD-H1000 design incorporates audiophile-grade components like the newly developed electrolytic capacitors and high-capacity (0.1 microfarads) copper film capacitors. The R-core toroidal transformer minimizes power supply leakage flux for clean power supply operation that helps maintain treble clarity and bass performance. This player also offers an eight-block isolated chamber to avoid mechanical and electrical interference, further preserving audio and video signal purity. Its hybrid metal construction effectively disperses and suppresses resonance peaks, with large BMC insulator feet helping to absorb external vibrations to further reduce unwanted noise. Virtual Battery Operation helps prevent AC power supply noise from entering the audio circuitry.This unit includes digital outputs for DTS and Dolby Digital decoders. Discrete component video outputs enable the transmission of digital video to compatible video equipment with component video inputs and for connection to two monitors at a time. Also included are an illuminated universal joystick remote and a warranty for a year on parts, 90 days on labor.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21JGTJNCHRL.jpg,,,Electronics,Television & Video,DVD Players & Recorders,DVD Players,,
Panasonic DVD-RV30 DVD Player,"The Panasonic DVD-RV30 DVD player offers Advanced Virtual Surround Sound (VSS) so that consumers who don't have the room or the budget for a full-blown home theater audio system can still enjoy superb audio. Advanced VSS creates a simulated surround sound effect, downmixed from either a 5.1-channel or 2-channel Dolby Digital soundtrack. The 2-Channel Plus Bass feature, combined with Advanced Virtual Surround Sound, will turn even a modest two-speaker system into a virtual movie theater experience. A dialogue enhancement feature boosts the volume of the center channel by 6 dB when playing a Dolby Digital 5.1 disc so that the dialogue doesn't become drowned out by the left and right speakers.  Other audio features include standard audio/video outs as well as an optical digital-audio output.Video features include a selectable cinema mode that enhances the picture by reducing glare, softening resolution, and improving visibility of details in dark scenes, resulting in a more realistic cinemalike image. The Panasonic DVD-RV30 is equipped with S-video outputs and component video out. Component video out digitally separates the video signal into its luminance (Y) and separate chrominance (PR and PB) elements, allowing delivery of a reference-quality picture with precise color reproduction. (The connected television or monitor must be compatible to attain the benefit of this feature.) Every Panasonic DVD player features high-speed, five-step, smooth-motion scan. This feature provides crystal-clear forward and reverse scan in five speeds. At the highest setting, the unit scans at 100 times normal speed.This model is Energy Star compliant, so it will draw significantly less power in the standby mode than noncompliant DVD products.

JVC XL-FZ158BK 5-Disc Carousel CD Changer,"JVC's XL-FZ158BK combines minimal features with surprisingly good sound in a five-CD changer that lists for well below $200. It's a tremendous value--as long as you can live without a remote control. Some will immediately bar the XL-FZ158BK from consideration for having no remote control, but the XL-FZ158BK's sound is so good that you might think about how often you actually use a CD remote (especially with a changer) before dismissing this player from consideration.In our experience, CD changers do not sound as good as their single-disc counterparts. The reason is simple: it's easier to make a stable transport mechanism, which does affect the sound, in a single-play unit than it is in a multiplay. That said, the XL-FZ158BK is an impressive performer. It's well balanced and smooth, with a laid-back high-frequency response that we attribute to JVC's proprietary 1-bit digital-to-analog converter. (To our ears, this is preferable to the bright high-end we've heard on other modestly priced machines.) The midrange, where the heart of music lies, is the XL-FZ158BK's most notable strength. Vocals and instruments such as piano and cello have fine presence and a sense of openness that consistently pull you into the music.In the features department, the XL-FZ158BK offers just the basics. Play exchange allows you to replace up to four discs while a fifth is playing, and you get the usual play, program, track skip, random play, and--a feature we love--a headphone jack with a volume control.An optical digital output allows connection to a digital recorder such as minidisc or CD, but also lets you integrate the XL-FZ158BK with a surround receiver. We would have preferred a higher-quality coaxial output, but optical is better than nothing.JVC has done a fine balancing act with the XL-FZ158BK, and it certainly deserves your consideration--assuming you don't mind getting up from your chair to operate it.--Wayne GarciaPros:Good soundSolid valueHeadphone jack has volume controlCons:No remote controlSlightly deemphasized high frequenciesNo coaxial digital output",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31JQYAQQZDL._SX300_.jpg,145.95,,Electronics,Home Audio,Stereo Components,CD Players & Recorders,CD Players,

Toshiba SD-2200 DVD Player,"Not long ago, we would have considered Toshiba's SD-2200 a steal. After all, this DVD player performs flawlessly when it comes to audio-video processing, resulting in good picture quality and dynamite sound. The SD-2200 also has dual-disc capacity, includes a built-in Dolby Digital decoder, and plays High Definition Compatible Discs (HDCDs). However, other manufacturers have caught up to Toshiba's lead in the DVD player arena, producing players of equal quality and reducing the SD-2200 to a good value rather than a steal.Toshiba has taken a step backwards in the SD-2200's design by offering a joystick-style remote control that inhibits your ability to easily access menus and perform setup functions.If the presence of a built-in Dolby Digital decoder appeals to you, however, the SD-2200 is worth its weight. In addition to offering 5.1-channel audio jacks, it has optical and coaxial digital-audio outputs, as well as composite-, component-, and S-video outputs.The front array of buttons and LEDs center around the disc tray, which loads a single disc at a time. We found the tray mechanism to be somewhat flimsy and prone to breakage. The automated mechanism also makes a disturbing humming noise for several seconds as it goes through its motions.A pair of open/close buttons--labeled 1 and 2--are on the right of the disc tray. (Curiously, there are no matching open/close disc buttons on the remote control.) A pair of LEDs flanks the left side of the disc tray. With two DVDs in the machine, a red LED indicates that the first disc is in standby or play mode, while a green LED shows that a second disc is ""on deck."" Combined with the red power indicator, we found these lights distracting in our darkened home theater. Given the fact that the SD-2200 has a front-panel display-off switch, it seems counterproductive for Toshiba to include three brightly colored LEDs.Other front-panel operating buttons include play, pause, stop, skip, and a redundant disc select button. Unfortunately, there is no menu access button in case the remote is lost or rendered inoperable. We also wished this unit had a headphone jack.The onscreen setup display is identical to other Toshiba models. A button on the remote brings up a bar at the top of the display device that hosts icons for language, picture, audio, display, and operation. Although all of these setup functions are intuitive, the remote makes it difficult to easily access them.The remote's ""joystick"" is actually a small toggle button that's designed to replace the standard up/down and left/right arrow buttons on most remotes. The toggle switch is overly sensitive and, when you are moving inside a given menu, it tends to move on to the next icon or accidentally select the wrong setting. For example, in picture setup, each time we attempted to select the 16:9 aspect ratio, we inadvertently moved over to the audio menu without completing our mission.Fortunately, once we completed all our menu selections and dimmed the lights, the SD-2200 exhibited the usual high-quality sound and image we've come to expect from Toshiba. One of Toshiba's best selling points is the company's unwavering focus on accurate gray-scale levels. The company adheres to the philosophy that faithful colors begin with a video decoder's ability to produce true black and the SD-2200's image quality shows this philosophy. Dark scenes were well defined instead of murky, while bright scenes showed off the player's ability to offer good edge definition, resulting in a more three-dimensional image. We were also pleased to see that the SD-2200 showed no digital artifacts during problematic action sequences with high data compression. Plus, we loved the onscreen meter, which allows you to monitor the bit-rate allocation for a given scene.Few manufacturers compare to Toshiba when it comes to offering superb digital-to-analog audio converters. With the SD-2200, explosions punched through the air with high velocity, while ambient sound effects trickled across the room with an eerie realism. Of course, there are many factors that contribute to a home theater system's ability to immerse the audience in a bug-infested jungle setting or to plop them down in the crowded streets of New York City. However, we have found that DVD players with inferior audio components invariably fail in this regard. Unlike lesser models, Toshiba's SD-2200 brought out the best in our test system.The SD-2200 scored high on music reproduction as well. On well-recorded, standard CDs, the SD-2200 reinforced the notion that a good DVD player is more than capable of doubling up for music listening. Dynamic range--the ability to reproduce the highest highs and the lowest lows--was clear and relatively distortion free. On High Definition Compatible Discs, the SD-2200 kicked into cruise control and delivered satisfying renditions of everything from grunge guitar to slow sax.If you're impartial about HDCDs and you already have a home theater system with Dolby Digital 5.1-channel processing, Toshiba's SD-2200 probably isn't a practical choice for a DVD player. After all, there are less expensive, single-disc players without built-in decoders, as well as higher-priced machines with more features and better build quality. If you want a DVD player that's well equipped for today's audio-video formats and does all the important things right, however, the SD-2200 is a good choice.--Eric GillPros:Versatile array of audio-video outputsBuilt-in Dolby Digital decoderExcellent digital-to-analog audio converterCons:Build quality isn't on par with players that cost only slightly moreJoystick-style remote makes it difficult to navigate onscreen menus",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/310VKDX7EJL._SX300_.jpg,33,,Electronics,Television & Video,DVD Players & Recorders,DVD Players,,

Pioneer PD-RW739 CD Recorder (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"The Pioneer PDR-W739 CD recorder serves the dual purpose of playing and recording audio CDs. It boasts a three-CD drawer-style changer on the left side and a CD-R (write once) and CD-RW (rewritable) recording deck on the right.This model employs the latest CD recording technologies, including 2x write speed, 2x finalization (the process required to listen to CD-Rs on standard CD players), autosync recording, Record Strategy Control (which optimizes recording for different brands of recordable media), and fade in/out recording capabilities (for those times when the last song doesn't quite fit).Trying to make a digital copy of a disc that is itself a digital copy? The PDR-W739's record-industry-appeasing SCMS (Serial Copy Management System) won't let you. You can, however, make ananalogcopy--when it reads an SCMS flag, the PDR-W739 automatically switches to an internal, auto-level-setting analog recording mode, which doesn't sound quite as good as a bit-for-bit digital copy but does achieve duplication.The PDR-W739 uses Burr Brown 24-bit, 96 kHz PCM1716 digital-to-analog and analog-to-digital converters, which sample at higher resolution than standard CDs to ensure the signal integrity of your audio.For playback, you can relay play all three CDs in the changeranda disc in the record deck, in sequence. Other convenience features include best-selection memory (which remembers up to 32 tracks from different discs for instant recall when the discs are loaded), one-button recording, and auto-level control for no-brainer analog recording (prevents unwanted digital distortion from too-loud input levels).To minimize mechanical errors, Pioneer's exclusive Record Strategy Control circuit alters the laser output in response to the characteristics of the brand of CD-R or CD-RW you're using.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41FH34H0H2L._SX300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Home Audio,Stereo Components,CD Players & Recorders,CD Recorders,

Digital tracking takes the blemishes out of picture quality, and the auto head cleaner assures quality performance.Designed to make time-shift recording fast and hassle-free, the Toshiba W704 features VCR Plus+ with C3 programming, which makes taping cable and broadcast programs a cinch. An onscreen programming system with visual icons guides users through every step of the recording process with point-and-click simplicity.

Toshiba W607 4-Head Hi-Fi VCR,"Toshiba's W607 VHS VCR costs a few dollars more than most of today's  entry-level VCR models, but its superior image quality, excellent audio, and  convenient layout of controls would be tough to beat in this price  range.While most low-priced VCRs feature small enclosures that look awkward  next to other components, the W607 has a full-size chassis finished in an  attractive dark gray. Its controls are laid out symmetrically around a central  tape slot and luminescent display, producing an attractive combination of visual  elegance, functional simplicity, and intuitive operation.For easy connection  of a camcorder or video game, a small, hinged door in the lower left-hand corner  conceals a set of gold-plated video and stereo audio inputs. In addition, a  prominent round button facilitates one-touch recording.The W607 delivered  some of the best-looking, sweetest-sounding movie experiences of any budget VCR  we've tested. Images were rich and detailed with low noise and vibrant colors,  although a slightly reddish tint to flesh tones indicated that the picture was  definitely on the warm, bluish side. A softening of small background objects  suggested a marginal loss of detail compared to more expensive decks.As you  might expect from a four-head machine, special effects (fast play, slow play and  still frame) were clear and stable, with little image ""jump"" during freeze-frame  viewing.Given the growing popularity of home theater, the W607's excellent  audio quality is a powerful asset. With both stereo and Dolby Pro Logic videos,  the sonic presentation tested the boundaries of our listening room. From the  shuddering bass of earthquakes through the most delicate, high-pitched tinkle of  breaking glass, the audio spectrum was reproduced with a precision unusual in  this price range.Clearly, Toshiba has outfitted this machine with an  extremely capable tuner; standard network programming through the W607's tuner  yielded a noticeable improvement in audio and video quality over the TV's  tuner.Enthusiasts who enjoy timeshifting--recording programs to view at their convenience--will appreciate the inclusion of VCR Plus+, which distills  programming chores to a few keystrokes of the remote control.There's also a  high-speed transport that can fast-forward or rewind a T-120 tape in less than  one minute. This ""smart"" system also slows the winding at the beginning and end  of the tape in order to minimize breakage.Finally, the remote control uses  buttons of various shapes and sizes to identify the different functions. The  transport keys (play, stop, fast-forward, and rewind) glow in the dark for quick  access in low-light situations. This upgraded transmitter has also been  preprogrammed to control most televisions.With its fine performance,  attractive aesthetics, and wealth of features, the W607 upholds Toshiba's tradition of offering outstanding value. Video mavens  seeking a VCR with ergonomics that are on par with its audio and video  capabilities won't find a better machine at this price.--Anthony  ChiarellaPros:Audio and video performance rivals higher-priced modelsA long list of welcome features is bolstered by a fine remote handsetSuperb control layout on attractive front panelCons:Compared to more expensive machines, images are slightly soft and warm",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31D47VMHWYL._SX300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Television & Video,VCRs,,,

Minolta Maxxum HTsi Plus 35mm SLR Camera Kit w/ 28-80mm Lens,"The Minolta Maxxum HTsi Plus provides the superior picture quality of a single-lens-reflex camera (SLR) with the easy-to-use automatic controls of a point-and-shoot camera. It's a good choice for both advanced photographers and beginners who want better-quality pictures.The picture quality of point-and-shoot cameras pales in comparison to those produced with an SLR camera, which gives you better optics, a through-the-lens view that lets you accurately frame your photos, and manual options for full control of your exposure and focus. If you are used to point-and-shoots, this camera makes the transition to SLRs easy; however, you'll have to refer to the manual to get the hang of using the extensive menu of advanced settings. In our tests, the HTsi Plus offered the full range of advanced controls--it let us set the aperture, exposure, and focus manually. The HTsi Plus also made it easy to switch into full automatic mode, in which we just pressed the shutter button, and the camera performed the focusing and exposure for us.The Minolta Maxxum HTsi Plus is quite lightweight for an SLR and includes both a pop-up flash and an external flash shoe. It includes five preset exposure modes including portrait, landscape, and macro; burst mode; aperture and shutter priority modes; and a self-timer. For serious amateurs or professionals, the HTsi Plus offers all the standard SLR functions, although we found its aperture setting method (you have to push the aperture preview button and turn the camera's selection wheel) a bit disorienting at first. The HTsi Plus's 28-80 zoom lens gave us a good range for everything from portraits to landscapes. We especially liked the automatic exposure bracketing and multiple exposure functions; these features are useful in getting the right shot and exercising your creativity.Pros:LightweightBuilt-in flashEasy to useHigh-quality opticsCons:Menu selection somewhat hard to figure outUnconventional aperture-selection method",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51N9SGSZZVL._SX300_.jpg,13.59,,Electronics,Camera & Photo,Film Photography,Film Cameras,SLR Cameras,

Panasonic SL-SX271C Portable CD Player with Car Kit,"Panasonic's SL-SX271C meets all the criteria that you should expect from a portable CD player with a car adapter kit. It's lightweight, feature packed, and built to endure the rigors of the road.To test the SL-SX271C's 40-second memory buffer, we deliberately dropped the player onto the floor from a height of two feet. The silver, plastic case bounced off the carpeting, flipped upside down, and did a belly flop onto the hard floor without skipping.Impressed by this unit's display of durability and memory protection, it came as no surprise that the SL-SX271C also passed our road test. We plugged the supplied cigarette adapter into our car, slid the cassette adapter into the vehicle's built-in deck, and set the portable CD player on the dashboard. Ten miles and countless potholes later, the music never stopped or even so much as hiccupped. Panasonic's SL-SX27C makes it easy to forget you're listening to a portable music box that costs a quarter the price of a custom-installed CD player. The SL-SX27C is also more theftproof than an in-dash player; just unplug the adapters, slip the SL-SX27C into a handbag or attach&eacute; case and lock the car.The SL-SX27C proved equally impressive when disconnected from a car. Panasonic thoughtfully includes a push button on the center of the CD tray that ejects discs so users don't have to pry discs loose with their fingertips. The battery door, located on the underside of the player, is a snap to open and close as well.The left side of the compact player houses the headphone jack as well as a thin volume dial, which proved too tiny for an average-size thumb. A Hold switch prevents the player from turning on while it's stored in your backpack or purse. Resume, Random, and Normal switches allows manual access to these functions without relying on the LED and Left/Right disc-skip buttons.The handsome top panel, with its LED display framed in metallic blue, sports an array of silver buttons, including antishock, skip-left and -right arrows, on/off, pause, and play. In addition, three tiny buttons activate memory/recall, repeat track/repeat all, and an equalizer.The equalizer offers S-XBS (Super Extra Bass System), which enhances the dynamics of every musical genre from classical to rock. Panasonic also incorporates a Train equalization mode and suggests you use it ""to avoid annoying other passengers with noise from your headphones while riding the train, or to reduce fatigue when listening for a long period of time."" Unfortunately, the difference between Train and Normal equalization modes was just barely discernible.The SL-S222's sound was impressive, thanks to Panasonic's acclaimed 1-bit MASH (multistage noise-shaping) technology and its comfortable headphones. The headphones outperformed the tinny, bass-anemic variety that come packaged with most portable CD players.As for programming features, the SL-SX27C has them covered as well, enabling users to program up to 24 tracks in any desired order. Panasonic's plainly written, well-illustrated instructions, and intuitive user interface helped us program an 18-track CD in preferred order in less than 20 seconds.Pros:Impressive 40-second antishock protectionBass friendly headphonesAttractive, ergonomic designEasy to program",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/410FKG0Y5AL._SX300_.jpg,234.99,,Electronics,Portable Audio & Video,Portable CD Players,,,
Panasonic SLSW505Y Yellow Shockwave Portable CD Player,"Although manufacturers of portable CD players often ignore build quality in favor of pretty colors, Panasonic's SL-SW505 offers an attractive design as well as excellent construction.The durable SL-SW505 Shock Wave sports bright colors and is made of extremely rigid plastic that isn't prone to breaking. We were impressed with the use of aluminum hinges for the lid, metal springs for the clamps, and metal screws throughout, as well as a plastic gasket for sealing the CD enclosure. The battery compartment is located under the lid, as are the resume play, random play, and antishock switches.Panasonic touts the SL-SW505 as a water-resistant CD player, but cautions that it's not intended to be submerged in water. Nevertheless, the player is designed to keep moisture out, with a locking lid and rubber plugs for the input and output jacks. The silver, plastic locking clamps are easy to open and close and won't inadvertently jar open.Ergonomically, we found the SL-SW505 to be a bit wanting, with awkward orange, plastic switches for the extra bass (XBS) and hold functions, and a rotary volume dial inconveniently located underneath the player. In order to adjust the volume we had to lift the player. Considering the SL-SW505's superb build quality, these minor inconveniences are forgivable, particularly since they're part of the water-resistant design. Less forgivable is the LCD display, which rests beneath a tinted, plastic window and is nearly impossible to read indoors.The play, pause, stop, and track-skip buttons are simple to access, with a nice feel. The SL-SW27C enables users to program up to 24 tracks in any order. Thanks to Panasonic's plainly written, well-illustrated instructions and intuitive user interface, programming is simple.The matching black-and-yellow headphones are lightweight and durable, if a little uncomfortable. The sound quality is only average, as the SL-SX271C lacks the bass output present in other Panasonic portable CD models we've tested.As the SL-SW505 includes ""Shock Wave"" as part of its official name, we'd be remiss not to comment on the 40-second antishock protection (ASP), which is superb. Thanks to Panasonic's proprietary multistage noise-shaping (MASH) 1-bit digital-to-analog converter, as well as the solid construction, the SL-SW505 held up to demanding tests. We pounded on the lid, twisted the player in the air, and dropped it on a hard surface from six inches. None of these actions caused the music to skip. This portable CD player is well designed for rugged outdoor use.--Eric GillPros:Superb build qualityImpressive 40-second antishock protectionAudio outputs for hooking up to a standalone systemCons:Display is difficult to readSound quality is just average",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/81DNE0VP40L._SX300_.gif,81.1,,Electronics,Portable Audio & Video,Portable CD Players,,,

Panasonic SLSX270 Portable CD Player,"Jogging, driving, or hiking doesn't preclude enjoying the music you love. The Panasonic SLSX270 is a durable, portable CD player with features to accommodate movement and seemingly adverse conditions.It sports a heat-resistant, polycarbonate casing, so you can confidently place it on the dash of your car without damaging the CD player. It also has a sliding lock to keep the lid closed during rougher handling. A one-push, full-open mechanism pops the lid and slightly ejects the disc, so you can easily load and remove your audio media. Its compact design lets you slip it into a pocket or, using the included neoprene belt, take it with you wherever you go.Panasonic offers a one-bit digital-to-analog converter to ensure exceptional signal linearity--you can hear every quiet note amid competing instruments. The super-extra bass system delivers hard-hitting low-end, while a digital servo system maintains accurate reading and playback.People who exercise can put in a disc, program their settings, and forget worries about changing those settings--a convenient hold switch prevents other buttons from being pressed accidentally, saving batteries as well as effort.A top-mounted liquid crystal display reveals operating details such as track information and whether antishock is on or off. The Panasonic SL-SX270 offers 24-track random-access programming that lets you listen to songs on a CD in the order you prefer or completely at random.Track and disc repeat automatically replays any song or, once the disc is over, it starts at the beginning without stopping. You can skip through the tracks, search, or pause the music, and a resume function plays the music from the exact same spot.To eliminate audio skips, Panasonic offers in this model version 3.0 of its enhanced antishock memory. It gives you virtually flawless playback, even during jolt-heavy activities like driving and jogging.How does it work? Panasonic's antishock system rotates discs faster than normal speed, reading the digital data into a memory buffer. When a vertical shock occurs along the axis of a disc and causes a tracking error, the system plays music, stored 40 seconds in advance, from its digital memory so the correct tracking resumes.Additionally, the antishock memory has a sophisticated new chip to correct horizontal shocks that occur in the plane of disc rotation and can sometimes force the disc to momentarily spin faster or slower.

Panasonic SLS222 Portable CD Player,"For a plain, silver CD player that weighs less than a paperback book, Panasonic's SL-S222 is full of surprises. While most portables open via a thumb switch on their front (which is prone to accidental opening), the SL-S222 has a large Open button on its top, making it much easier to insert and remove discs. Panasonic also thoughtfully includes a push button on the center of the CD tray that ejects discs, so you don't have to pry CDs loose with your fingertips. The battery door, located on the back of the player, is a snap to open and close as well.The right side of this compact player houses the headphone jack along with an assortment of hidden switches and a thin volume dial that may be too tiny for some thumbs. A Hold switch prevents the player from accidentally turning on while it's stored in your backpack or purse. Resume, Random, and Normal switches offer manual access to these functions without relying on the LED and Left/Right disc-skip buttons. We found the manual Random function most useful, since it automatically programs random tracks at the flip of the switch.The player also has an S-XBS (Super Extra Bass System), which we opted to keep on all the time, as it enhances the dynamics of all musical genres, from classical to rock. Finally, an antishock deactivation switch enables users to save battery life while the player is stationary.Initially, Panasonic's 10-second antishock protection seemed insufficient, as many players within the same price range sport 40-second memory buffers. However, we were proved wrong in our tests--after tapping it, shaking it, turning it upside down, and dropping it from several inches off the ground, the SL-S222 still refused to skip.We were impressed with the sound of the SL-S222, which incorporates Panasonic's acclaimed 1-bit MASH (multistage noise-shaping) technology. Panasonic's seemingly flimsy headphones outclassed our standby portable set, which are usually preferable to the tinny, bass-anemic variety that come with most portable CD players.As for programming features, the SL-S222 has those covered as well. It enables you to program up to 24 tracks in any desired order. Thanks to Panasonic's plainly written, well-illustrated instructions and intuitive user interface, we were able to program a CD containing 18 tracks in preferred order in less than 20 seconds.In addition to its affordable price, the SL-S222 impressed us with its bass-rich headphones, rock-solid antishock memory, smart features, and superb ergonomics.--Eric GillPros:Reliable antishock protectionGood headphonesGreat ergonomic designEasy to programCons:Construction is slightly flimsy",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/418HEJWJZDL._SX300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Portable Audio & Video,Portable CD Players,,,

In our tests, the headset was extremely versatile and required little assembly. The microphone can ostensibly be worn with the headband on either ear or it can be hung from the ear using the included large and small ear attachments. However, in our tests, the microphone did not stay in place well unless worn with the headband.The sound quality of the earpiece and microphone were both clear. The headband was light and sturdy as well, making it comfortable to wear for long periods of time. The KX-TAC90 has a noise-canceling microphone that eliminates background noise and makes your voice more easily understandable to callers. It also has a 4-foot cord with an adjustable clothing clip to give you even greater range of motion.All in all, the Panasonic KX-TAC90 is a well-built item that's sure to add mobility and productivity to phone calls.--Megan DuganPros:Quick and easy assemblyReversible microphone and earpieceCons:Ear-hanging option doesn't work well",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41EM555P74L._SX300_.jpg,9.9,,Electronics,Accessories & Supplies,Telephone Accessories,Headsets,,

"Lomo Action Sampler 35mm 4 Lens Camera with Four Sequential Exposures, Chrome Color","The Action Sampler takes a great idea and turns it into a fun little camera. This camera uses four lenses to capture four different photos on one frame of film. The Action Sampler takes the photos a fraction of a second apart, creating an ""action sample"" that shows the sequence of motion. (Click on the ""More Pictures"" link at the top of this page to see sample photos that were taken with the Action Sampler.)Brought to you by the same folks who produce the famous Lomo camera, the Action Sampler shares the Lomo's wacky, creative image--as evidenced in the glossy, photo-filled little manual that comes with the camera and is a work of art in itself. The Action Sampler is also a study in styling with its colorful, plastic see-through case. It doesn't have a flash and sports only a flip-up square of pink plastic to frame your photos. Everything is manual, including film loading, winding, and rewinding, and there are no settings to fiddle with.As the manual blithely states, ""The Action Sampler is not a finely tuned piece of apparatus made only of the finest in hand-crafted modern materials. It's made of plastic."" In short, this means you shouldn't expect sharp, detailed pictures. However, you can expect truly unique, fun, and often striking sequences of photos. The Action Sampler uses normal 35mm film but needs plenty of light (outdoor photos turn out the best), so if you want to use it indoors, we recommend using a higher-speed film (ISO 400 or higher).The Action Sampler is a blast to use, and it makes a great gift. While it has its limitations, its distinctive way of seeing the world is fun and exciting.--Holly BlumenthalPros:Captures action with four photos on one frameEasy to useColorful, unique stylingUses normal 35mm film (2 rolls included)Cons:Cheaply constructedNeeds lots of lightRelatively low-quality pictures",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/419ysjYsb2L._SY300_.jpg,99.99,,Electronics,Camera & Photo,Film Photography,Film Cameras,Point & Shoot Film Cameras,

Lomo Kompakt Automat 35mm Camera,"The unique Lomo opens up a whole new world of creative photography. Built as sturdy as a tank, the black retro-looking Lomo was originally designed by a top-secret military optics factory in the Soviet Union and is still made by hand in the St. Petersburg factory. It's easy to use, takes normal 35mm film, and gives you brilliant colors and superb night photos.But the Lomo is more than just a cool camera--it's part of a worldwide community and a refreshingly new artistic movement, Lomography, that encourages even nonartists to be creative. The philosophy is to be quick, don't think, be open to your surroundings, absorb everything, and enjoy communicating. The Lomo craze started in the Viennese underground scene and rapidly expanded until all across the globe people became armed with Lomos, recording everything in bright colors and strange shapes. There are major Lomo exhibitions and events around the world. And famous folks such as David Byrne, The Verve, and Yassir Arafat own Lomos.When we first heard of the Lomo, the hype and &uuml;ber-hipness made us quite skeptical. How could this little Soviet camera create such a stir? But we fell for the Lomo as soon as we got the package, which includes a little German hardbound book of Lomographs (plus the English translation) and two rolls of Lomo brand film--along with the ""What the hell is Lomo?"" instruction manual.After we used the Lomo for a week or so, it became quite obvious why folks were raving about it--the Lomo allows for an unprecedented amount of creativity, and (most importantly) it makes photography inexpensive and easy.The secret to the Lomo is its superb light meter and its exposure method--it exposes film for however long is necessary. This results in amazing night photographs, with glowing neon, streaking lights, ghostly people, and a real sense of motion. Daytime shots are equally interesting, filled with color and accentuated by the Lomo's slight distortion and tendency to darken photos towards the edges. The Lomo has no flash, so you won't get photos of people with red eyes and pasty skin tones or pictures with underexposed backgrounds. The Lomo lens has a coating that renders both day and night with incredible richness and brilliance. Our skies were a deep blue, our yellows scintillating, and our night scenes alive with the colors of city lights. (Click on the ""More Pictures"" link at the top of this page to see sample photos that were taken with the Lomo.)Another major advantage to the camera is that the Lomo works best with cheap 100-speed 35mm film, which is readily available anywhere and is easy to process. ISO 100 film is actually best at capturing brilliant colors and enhances the Lomo's natural tendency for producing color-rich photos.Most importantly, the Lomo is wonderfully simple to use--the only adjustments you have to make are to set the film speed and to set the focus lever (marked with four distances from 0.8 meters to infinity). All you do is point the Lomo, set the distance, press the button, and the camera decides how long to expose the picture.The viewfinder and lens open at the same time with a single lever--a good design that makes it impossible to mistakenly leave the lens cover on. You can easily slip the Lomo into your pocket without worrying about a case. Film loading, advance, and rewind are all manual--after using these features once, you'll get the hang of loading film quickly. The distance lever is also self-explanatory, and the distance markings show up inside the viewfinder as well.If you want a modern point-and-shoot with autofocus, auto film winding, a zoom lens, and a flash, the Lomo is not for you. You won't get perfect, always-sharp photos with the Lomo, and many of your pictures will be blurred, streaked, and bizarre looking. But that's the whole point--with the Lomo, you'll get striking, unique, artistic results. You probably can achieve these results with a normal SLR camera, but it would require much more work and money.Overall, we felt the Lomo lived up to its global reputation. With its simplicity, inexpensiveness, and striking results, it's an easy-to-use tool for creative fun photography.--Holly BlumenthalSPECIAL CAVEAT: The Lomo Kompakt Automat is for the steady-handed and the artistically fearless. It is not the same thing as using a typical, modern point-and-shoot camera. Even though you may be buying it brand-spanking new, you might think of the Lomo as a clever camera you discovered in the back room of a dusty old second-hand shop during your travels through Eastern Europe. Handle it with care until you get the hang of its quirks. For example, loading the film is slightly tricky. Make sure it is properly winding around the spool before closing the back of the camera. If you have trouble getting the shutter to click, check to see if the lever that opens the lens cover has been pushed all the way to the right side. Even if the lens cover remains just slightly ajar, the shutter button won't respond when you press on it. Also, when you finish a roll of film, make certain you push in the rewind button on the bottom of the camera before you manually rewind the film. Otherwise, you will damage your film. If any of this sounds daunting, it really isn't. It's all just part of the fun of going Lomo.Pros:Yields brilliant supersaturated colorsTakes amazing night photosSturdy, stylish retro constructionUses normal 35mm filmEasy to useCons:Manual film loading, winding, and focusingPhotos aren't always sharp",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GD6RP2VYL._SX300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Camera & Photo,Film Photography,Film Cameras,Point & Shoot Film Cameras,

Original Monster Cable Clear Jacket - High Performance Speaker Cable - 10 ft. pair - 3.04 m.,"Measurements:Outer Diameter: 10.93mm Wide, 5.52mm TallVariance: +/- .1mmMonster Cable: Required Equipment for Today's Sound SystemsLike an improperly designed pipe that restricts water flow and makes a pump work harder, ordinary speaker wire in your sound system makes your amp work harder &#150; restricting power, reducing clarity, compressing dynamic range, and increasing the distortion in your music. Recommended by more audio manufacturers, audio critics, and audiophiles world-wide than any other cable, Monster Cable is specially designed to handle complex high-current audio signals. We use more copper for better power transfer, finer strands for improved highs, and a special winding configuration to help maintain signal integrity and provide greater clarity and less distortion in the music.Now Hear What You've Been MissingRock or classical, analog or digital, Monster Cable makes all your recordings come alive. There's more ""punch"" to the sound. Smoother highs, a tighter bass, and a clearer midrange. With greater clarity, you'll hear details you never heard before. Most exciting of all, you'll experience better depth and imaging &#150; creating a more ""live"" and natural listening experience. And to make sure you keep enjoying great sound, we jacket Monster Cable with out exclusive Duraflex&reg;to protect against abrasion and temperature extremes. We provide you with precision machined, Lock-Notch connectors that won't come loose or inadvertently pull out. And we plate each connector with corrosion-proof 24k gold for maximum conductivity.Get All the Sound You Paid ForIt's a fact. The performance of your sound system can only be as good as the cables you use to connect it. By connecting your speakers with Monster Cable, your system can achieve its maximum level of performance. Once your ears get tuned into high-performance sound, we invite you to audition other Monster products, including our full line of Interlink&reg;interconnects for the best possible performance from your preamp, amp, tuner, tape deck, or CD player, and Monster Video&reg;video cables for your VCR, TV, LaserDisc player, camcorder or home theatre system.

Contax TVS 5MP Digital Camera w/ 3x Optical Zoom,"The Contax TVS digital camera makes use of a Carl Zeiss Vario Sonnar lens and a 5.2 megapixel sensor to create high-quality images that can be printed at sizes of up to 20 by 30 inches. Encased in a smooth titanium body and sporting a sapphire shutter release button, the TVS is stylistically impressive and durable enough to last through all kinds of photography projects. The camera also has a 3x optical zoom, movie mode, USB and video connections, and compatibility with MMD and SD memory cards.Optics and ResolutionThe Carl Zeiss lens' anti-reflection coating keeps unwanted light from flooding the CCD sensor, meaning images will have higher contrast, crisper colors, and more shadow detail. The large 1/1.8-inch CCD yields an effective 5 million pixels, and captures images with resolutions as high as 2560 by 1920 pixels. This means you can create quality, poster-sized prints of up to 20 by 30 inches. For greater customization and to save memory, you can select lower resolution settings (1600 x 1200, 1280 x 960, 640 x 480). The TVS has a 3x optical zoom and a 4x digital zoom, for a total zoom range of 12x.Storage and TransferThe Contax camera is compatible with both MultiMedia (MMC) and Secure Digital (SD) cards. This allows greater flexibility in sharing or transporting your photos among a variety of electronic devices, such as PDAs and cell phones. Use the built-in USB port to connect to a computer for fast and easy transfer of images.Movie ModeThe TVS can also record up to full-motion video clips with or without sound. Clips are saved in standard AVI format and can be set to two different resolution settings, 320 x 120 (up to 30 seconds per clip) and 160 x 120 (up to 120 seconds per clip). You can also view your video and photos on a TV using the video out port.More FeaturesThe 1.6-inch LCD monitor helps you compose your shots and navigate through the camera's settings with an onscreen menu. The dual backlight system increases light transmission from the LCD to increase visibility even in full daylight. The camera has fully automatic functions such as focus, exposure, and white balance for easy operation, but you can set them to presets or manual mode for greater control.Power, Size, and ContentsThe camera is powered by a rechargeable lithium ion battery.

ThinkPad T40 2373 - Pentium M 1.5 GHz - 14.1 &quot; - 512 MB Ram - 40 GB HDD,"No matter how specific your requirements, chances are IBM has a ready-made notebook to cover them. Incredibly compact and packed with enough amenities to satisfy the average notebook user, this model, the IBM ThinkPad T40 (23737CU), strikes a good balance between affordability and performance. If you want upscale perks such as DVD burning or oodles of memory, you may want to look into another ThinkPad, but the ThinkPad T40 (23737CU) is otherwise a solid yet comparatively economical way to enter the dependable world of ultra-portable IBM notebooks.Driven by a 1.5 GHz Intel Pentium M processor with Intel's new Centrino technology (Centrino processors offer improved battery life and more power than similarly rated non-Centrino CPUs) and a minimal alloent of 256 MB PC2100 DDR SDRAM memory, the ThinkPad T40 (23737CU) will adequately run most any standard mobile task, but may have trouble in instances of complex multitasking. Fortunately, a quick RAM upgrade -- the unit supports up to 2 full GB -- will solve that potential hitch. The system's graphics controller, an ATI Mobility Radeon 7500 with 32 MB of dedicated video memory, will more than suffice for midlevel 3-D applications but shouldn't be counted upon for high-end 3-D games and design.Tipping the scales at a scant 4.5 pounds and measuring just 12.2 by 10.0 by 1.0 inches, the ThinkPad T40 (23737CU) is exceptionally easy to transport and operate. IBM has equipped the unit with a midsize 40 GB hard disk for your everyday file and program access, a CD-RW/DVD-ROM drive through which you can listen to and burn audio CDs and watch DVD movies, and a 14.1-inch TFT display screen (1400 by 1050 maximum resolution). In its stock configuration, the unit does not support DVD playing or CD burning, though other ThinkPads certainly do.The ThinkPad T40 (23737CU) is home to many unique and practical perks, including a nifty keyboard-illuminating ThinkLight for low-light situations, an S-Video out port, two high-speed USB 2.0 ports for fast interaction with external peripherals, and a full-size keyboard featuring IBM's user-friendly ThinkPad UltraNav multi-pointing system. An IEEE 1394 FireWire connection, typically used for downloading data from digital camcorders, is not part of the package.Communication options include a low-speed 56K fax/modem, a standard 10/100 Ethernet connector for high-speed network access, and provisions for wireless upgradeability.

It transfers music at up to 64x speed, and the included SonicStage Jukebox software stores and manages digital music files, custom playlists, and music transfers, making it a cinch to transfer music to the device. A stereo minijack mic input accepts a range of microphones and is convenient for a variety of applications, and the unit comes with a built-in rechargeable battery capable of boosting battery life to 58 hours of playback when used in conjunction with a single AA battery.Taking advantage of high-speed transfers from a PC via a direct USB connection, the MZ-N10 can record more than five hours of music on one 80-minute minidisc (using LP4 mode). It also uses Sony's skip-free G-Protection technology, which eliminates or reduces skipping during many active uses. The MZ-N10 is compatible with the RealOne music player and the pressplay.com online music subscription service. It plays back ATRAC3 files and supports multiple Internet audio formats, including MP3, WMA, and WAV. The unit provides up to 56 hours of continuous playback on one AA battery.Recording is faster and easier than ever using the long-play LP4 mode and a supplied matching USB cradle with a direct connection to the jukebox. Placing the unit in the connected cradle also ensures that it automatically recharges.The MZ-N10 also features an editing remote with a backlit LCD and a three-line dot-matrix display that shows nine characters per line for easy song searches and edits. Sony's Jog Dial navigator scrolls through track lists vertically to search for songs and groups--you can access desired points by simply rotating the dial with one finger then pushing it. A handy feature called Personal Disc Memory stores your preferred settings for listening volume and other functions when playing your favorite minidiscs.The Easy Skip group-folder function helps you organize songs into albums or groups. Once transferred to the MZ-N10, you can easily skip from group to group. Besides the bundled SonicStage software and SonicStage simple burner application, the MZ-N10 also includes software for creatively organizing your music. MoodLogic software goes beyond typical jukebox applications, letting you compile music by mood or tempo rather than simply by artists and song titles.MoodLogic corrects your file information by identifying and re-titling mislabeled tracks during ID3 tag cleaning. It also has a feature called Music Marker, which lets you ""tag"" music during playback. Once you reconnect the device to your PC, MoodLogic retrieves the marks, connects you to the Musiclub Web site, and provides you with information about the song and artist as well as with links to download new tracks, purchase CDs, or discover similar artists.Here's how you can use the included Sonic Stage Software to manage your music files:What's in the BoxMD player/recorder, AC-ES605 AC power adapter, USB cradle (battery-charging stand), RM-MC33EL/S slim-stick backlit LCD remote control, MDR-A34SP headphones, dry-battery case (for 1 AA battery), digital cord, SonicStage version 1.5 CD-ROM (with Net MD Simple Burner software), USB cable, user's manual, warranty information.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Z658HNV0L._SX300_.jpg,8.95,,Electronics,Portable Audio & Video,MP3 Players & Accessories,MP3 Player Accessories,Speaker Systems,

It's the best way to add wireless capability to your existing wired network, or to add bandwidth to your wireless installation.The Dual-Band Wireless A+G Access Point actually contains two separate wireless connectivity radio transceivers, which support all three popular wireless networking specifications. The first transceiver uses the 2.4 GHz radio band, supporting both the widely-used and inexpensive Wireless-B (802.11b) standard at 11 Mbps, and the new, almost five times faster, Wireless-G (draft 802.11g) at 54 Mbps. The second radio operates in the 5 GHz band, and supports Wireless-A (802.11a) networking, also at 54 Mbps. Since the two radios operate in different bands, they can work simultaneously, blanketing your wireless zone with high-speed bandwidth.To protect your data and privacy, the A+G Access Point can encrypt all wireless transmissions. The MAC Address filter lets you decide exactly who has access to your wireless network while Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS) puts your network on the cleanest channel in your location. Configuration is a snap with the web browser-based configuration utility.With the Linksys Dual-Band Wireless A+G Access Point, you'll have the best of all worlds--Wireless-B for legacy compatibility, and both Wireless-G and Wireless-A for high-speed access.See acomparison         diagramof the different wireless technologies.Wireless networks are rapidly         becoming more popular and coming down in price.

Cisco-Linksys WRT55AG Dual-Band Wireless A+G Access Point + Cable/DSL Router with 4-Port 10/100 Switch,"From the Manufacturer An Internet-Sharing Router and Switch, with Universal Wireless Access (A, B, and G).The Dual-Band Wireless A+G Broadband Router is like four devices in one box! The Router function lets you securely share one high-speed Internet connection among your entire network, while the 4-port full duplex 10/100 Switch jump-starts your wired-Ethernet network. Connect four PCs directly, or daisy-chain out to more hubs and switches to create as big a network as you need.The Dual-Band Wireless A+G Broadband Router also contains two Wireless Access Points, supporting all three wireless networking specifications. The first Access Point uses the 2.4 GHz radio band, supporting both the popular and inexpensive Wireless-B (802.11b) standard at 11 Mbps, and the new, almost five times faster, Wireless-G (802.11g) at 54 Mbps. The second Access Point radio operates in the 5GHz band, and supports Wireless-A (802.11a) networking, also at 54 Mbps. Since the two radios operate in different bands, they can work simultaneously, blanketing your wireless zone with bandwidth.To protect your data and privacy, the Dual-Band Wireless A+G Broadband Router can encrypt all wireless transmissions. The MAC Address filter lets you decide exactly who has access to your wireless network. The Router also serves as a DHCP Server, has NAT technology to protect against Internet intruders, DMZ capability, supports VPN pass-through, and can be configured to filter internal users' access to the Internet. Configuration is a snap with the Web browser-based configuration utility.With the Linksys Dual-Band Wireless A+G Broadband Router at the center of your home or office network, you can share a high-speed Internet connection, files, printers, and multi-player games with the flexibility, speed, and security you need!For more information on the differences between an Access Point and a Router with Access Point, see the following table:See acomparison diagramof the different wireless technologies.Wireless networks are rapidly becoming more popular and coming down in price. Since they don't require cables, you can use the devices anywhere in an office or home, even out on the patio. There's no need to roll out an Ethernet network cable to each room of a house; you can network anywhere -- without wires. Outside of the home, wireless networking is available in hotspots at coffee shops, businesses, airports -- great when you're on the road and need to get some work done. For convenience, wireless networking is the answer.What Wireless Standard is Right for Me?Now that you've decided to create a wireless network, the next step is to figure out which wireless standard to use.Basically, a standard is a set of specifications for a device. All devices that follow a specific standard share operating characteristics, such as the radio frequency used and maximum data transfer speed.For wireless networking, there are three standards to choose from at this time:802.11b802.11a802.11g802.11a/gTo learn about the differences between the standards and select the right one for your network,click herefor an easy-to-understand chart.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41814EW3FCL._SX300_.jpg,219.95,,Electronics,Computers & Accessories,Networking Products,Switches,,

The C-5050 Zoom adds a new dimension to underwater photography with its super bright f1.8 lens for flash-less photography in low light, and super macro mode for shooting sea creatures from only an inch away.StylishThe underwater housing is made of durable transparent polycarbonate with grips and levers fashioned out of distinctive red-colored polycarbonate. The transparent nature of the housing ensures that users can view their shots with ease, as well as show off the stylish body of the camera.InnovativeThe housing features fluorite (FL) glass lens windows for greater clarity when shooting photos underwater. To reduce glare caused by sunlight on a digital camera LCD, the housing features an LCD hood located on the outside back of the housing that makes viewing the LCD easier above and below water.IntelligentOlympus has thought of everything to keep digital cameras safe and dry within the housing. O-ring seals, special rubber rings engineered to fit perfectly within corresponding grooves, expand under water pressure to tighten the seal when the shells of the housings are locked. To keep the O-ring in optimal condition, the included O-ring pic removes the ring without damaging the housing or the O-ring itself. Then, silicone grease, also included, can be applied to keep the O-ring properly lubricated and maintain its condition. Furthermore, safety locks on the housing prevents accidental opening.ApproachableThe housing's stainless steel nickel-plated brass mechanical control buttons, also sealed with silicon O-rings, allow full access to the cameras' functions and menus. With the touch of levers, zoom and shutter are easily operated.

They reduce glare and light scattering, increase contrast through selective filtration, increase definition and resolution, reduce irradiation and lessen eye fatigue. Celestron's filters are made of high quality, solid plane parallel glass with excellent homogeneity. They're anti-reflection-coated to prevent glaring and ghosting. All eyepiece filters are threaded to fit Celestron's and most other manufacturer's 1 1/4-inch eyepieces, and offer a full 26 millimeter clear aperture.Celestron color filters are mounted in black anodized aluminum cells with the Kodak Wratten series number individually engraved, and they come available in 4 assorted kits packed in plastic cases. The cells of each filter are double-threaded, so they can be stacked (piggybacked) in various combinations. This allows you to create different color combinations and transmission characteristics, or to have the same color characteristic but with a lower transmission. When stacking color filters, the effective transmission of the combination you create is equal to the product of the spectral transmission of each of the filters used.The effectiveness of the filters depends on several factors including the aperture and focal length of the telescope, the magnification being used, and seeing conditions.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/414k0yTj5VL._SY300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Camera & Photo,Accessories,Telescope & Microscope Accessories,Telescope Accessories,Filters

JVC MX-GT88 Compact Shelf System (Silver) (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"Looking for a compact stereo system with slamming low-end authority? Look no further. Whether JVC's MX-GT88 can really be called ""compact"" may open to debate, but rest assured that the system houses a three-disc carousel changer, a dual-well, full-logic cassette deck, an FM/AM tuner with 45 presets (30 FM, 15 AM), as well as 70 watts per channel for the speakers and a rafter-rattling 160 watts per channel for the system's two large-diaphragm subwoofers.The speakers are in many ways the focal point of the MX-GT88. Each speaker is outfitted with a 4.75-inch cone woofer, a two-inch cone tweeter, and an additional 7.875-inch cone subwoofer with six-layer voice coils for extra efficiency. The subwoofers even get their own separate, three-position level control.And no, the massive ""giga-tubes"" perched atop each of the MX-GT88's speakers aren't jet engines, though they're definitely designed to move air.

Celestron SkyMaster Giant 15x70 Binoculars with Tripod Adapter,"Binoculars come in a wide range of shapes and sizes these days, and  an even wider range of prices.  It's easy to spend less than $100 or more  than $500 for what may appear to be, at least outwardly, comparable models.   While they may look the same, they are probably quite different on the  inside.Recently, the binocular market has seen a flood of giant binoculars at  prices that were unheard of just a few years ago.  In general, giant  binoculars are defined as those that magnify the view 10 times or more and  have 70-mm or larger front (objective) lenses.  It used to be that the least  expensive giant binoculars cost in excess of $150, even $200.  All that  changed not long ago, when the bottom fell out of the price cellar.  Now,  several companies import giant binoculars that sell for half that, or less.Celestron's 15x70 SkyMaster binoculars are one of the leaders in the  low-price giant binocular arena.  They certainly sound good on paper.  The  SkyMasters include multicoated optics and BaK-4 internal prisms, two  features that promise brighter, better images, and key points to look for  when judging a pair of binoculars.  They also come with an adapter for  attaching them to a photo tripod, which is a must to use them to their  fullest, and a soft carrying case.  But just because they are cheap doesn't  always mean they are worth the price.  Would it be better to save up for a  more expensive pair?To find the answer, I had an opportunity recently to judge the SkyMasters  against a pair ofFujinon 16x70 FMT-SX binoculars, one of  the finest pairs of giant binoculars sold today.  Like the SkyMasters, the  Fujinons feature BaK-4 prisms, but also have fully multicoated optics.  As a  general rule, superior coatings mean superior image sharpness and contrast.   But then, that should be expected, given that the Fujinons cost many times  more than the Celestrons.While the Fujinons were clearly the better performer, the Celestron  SkyMasters held up admirably.  Image brightness, quality, and contrast were  all remarkable considering their bargain price.  Although images were a  little soft across the outer 25% of the Celestron's field, the overall view  was impressive nonetheless.Some inexpensive binoculars have very sloppy focusing, causing the eyepieces  to tilt and shift.  Not so with the SkyMasters.  I found that their  center-focusing mechanism worked smoothly, with no apparently backlash or  wobble.  Eye relief (the distance you hold your eyes away from the eyepieces  to see the full field) is stated to be 18 mm, a good distance for higher  power binoculars and an important consideration if you must wear glasses  when viewing.  The SkyMasters are also light enough to support by hand for  short periods of time, although buyers would be well advised to mount them  on a sturdy photo tripod.The bottom line is, if you are considering a pair of giant binoculars,  whether for bird watching, stargazing, or another recreational use, and have  a limited budget, Celestron's giant 15x70 SkyMasters represent an excellent  value. --Phil Harrington, author ofStar WareandStar WatchPros:Exceptional value for the priceLight enough to support by handBaK-4 prismsMulticoated opticsCons:Outer 25% of the field is soft and a little blurryRequires a tripod to use for extended periods",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ADnGTqmeL._SY300_.jpg,64,Celestron,Electronics,Camera & Photo,Binoculars & Scopes,Binoculars,,

"Toshiba Satellite 1135-S125 Laptop (1.80-GHz Celeron, 256 MB RAM, 30 GB Hard Drive, DVD/CD-RW Drive)","Some compromise is expected when investing in a ""budget"" computer. Toshiba's entry-level Satellite 1135-S125 Notebook, for example, definitely isn't a powerhouse. It will, however, suffice for most standard mobile computing tasks, without breaking the bank.Based upon a 1.8 GHz Intel Celeron processor, the Satellite 1135-S125 clearly sports less raw power than its pricier Pentium 4-equipped Satellite counterparts. Toshiba has matched this CPU with an adequate allotment of 256 MB RAM (expandable to 1024 MB), a 32 MB Intel 852GM graphics chipset and an adequate 30 GB hard drive. Consequently, the system is quite satisfactory for most common business and personal applications apart from high-end games and 3-D animation packages.Otherwise, the Satellite 1135-S125 is equipped with a multitude of features normally reserved for mid- to high-end models, including a full 15-inch display screen capable of 1024 by 768 resolution. The system's integrated optical drive incorporates DVD-ROM with CD-RW technology to allow you to backup your data, listen to and burn music CDs and watch the latest movies. The integrated keyboard features 85 full-size keys, 12 function keys and a TouchPad pointing device with scroll capability. And if you need future expandability, the Satellite 1135-S155 features two memory slots (both of which may be occupied) and dual PC Card slots.The long list of connectivity options includes an integrated 56K modem for low-speed e-communications, a 10/100 Ethernet LAN for high-speed Internet and network operations, an S-Video TV-out, a printer port, and a trio of ultra-fast USB 2.0 ports. The system does not include an IEEE 1394 FireWire connection, nor does it permit wireless communication.The Satellite 1135-S125 is unexpectedly portable at 13 by 11 by 1.7 inches and just 6.8 pounds. Under ideal conditions, battery life is estimated at 3 hours.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51H45Q0QSSL._SY300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Computers & Accessories,Laptops,,,

D-Link DI-774 Tri-Mode Dualband 4-Port Wireless Router (2.4/5  GHz),"D-Link, the industry pioneer in wireless networking, introduces another breakthrough in wireless connectivity:  the D-Link AirXpert DI-774 wireless router. This four-port, tri-mode, dualband router provides the most expanded user bandwidth available in a router. Hundreds of wireless clients can connect to this router using any one of its 11 non-overlapping channels to transfer data at speeds up to 5 times faster than previous wireless devices.The DI-774 operates seamlessly and simultaneously in both the 2.4GHz and 5GHz frequency spectrums supporting the 802.11b and the newer, faster 802.11a and 802.11g wireless standards. For offices, schools or public hotspots that already use 802.11b devices, the DI-774 is a great way to expand an existing network and enable even more users to communicate with one another, access data and the Internet. Now, you can have a router that will complement your existing network and protect the investment you made when you provided the convenience of wireless networking.The DI-774 offers transfer rates with a maximum wireless signal rate of up to 54Mbps in either the 2.4GHz or 5GHz bands. So, now large data packets travel from the router to a remote desktop or roaming laptop PC at up to five times the speed of previous wireless devices enabling everyone to work faster and more efficiently or watch a streaming video smoothly.Network administrators can also partition the usage of the DI-774 by segmenting users on the wireless network by frequency band. Users who require special networking privileges, such as access to sensitive company data, videoconferencing, or connectivity to specific departments, may use just the 802.11a channels; while other employees may just use the 802.11b and 802.11g channels. This type of user segmentation optimizes the router's performance and delivers the best network experience to each set of users.The DI-774 is ideal for those who require additional management, firewall, and other network security features, the 802.1x standard for wireless user authentication and WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) which dynamically encrypts data as it's being sent. And because the DI-774 allows the pass-through of multiple, concurrent IPSec and PPTP VPN sessions, IT managers can deploy DI-774s to their company's telecommuters and other remote employees who need to access sensitive information from a server or database or to communicate to a colleague confidentially. Filters on the router can also be set to restrict access to it based on the specific MAC addresses of wireless laptop or desktop cards on the network, or restrict the access of IP addresses, specific websites and/or web domain names. All of the router's settings are easily accessible in the operating system independent, Web-based software user interface that also features a step-by-step Setup Wizard to get the DI-774 up and running in just a matter of minutes.The DI-774 also features an integrated 4-port switch allowing direct Ethernet connection to up to four computers for additional Internet or resource sharing at wire speeds.Note:  Maximum wireless signal rate based on IEEE Standard 802.11a and 802.11g specifications. Actual data throughput will vary. Network conditions and environmental factors lower actual data throughput rate.

"HP Pavilion ze5375us Laptop (2.40-GHz Pentium 4, 512 MB RAM, 40 GB Hard Drive, DVD/CD-RW Drive)","As the least expensive member of HP's upscale Pavilion ze5000 series of mobile computers, the Pavilion ze5375us Notebook PC features all the processing power of its pricier siblings but with a slightly less substantial feature list. If speed is important but budgetary concerns are paramount, the Pavilion ze5375us Notebook PC is a wise choice.Driving the unit is a potent 2.4 GHz Intel Pentium 4 CPU and a generous allotment of 512 MB of DDR SDRAM (expandable to 1024 MB). Handling the 3-D video chores is a 64 MB ATI Mobility Radeon graphics chipset with 64 MB of shared (not dedicated) memory, which will make short work of all 2-D and most 3-D applications but won't efficiently display the latest 3-D games.Measuring 12.96 by 10.72 by 1.79 inches and weighing 7.5 pounds, the Pavilion ze5375us is a comfortable carry. The unit features an adequate 40 GB hard disk on which to store your programs and files and a convenient DVD/CD-RW combo drive through which you can burn and play audio CDs, archive data, and watch the latest movies. Its integrated 15-inch XGA TFT display is now the notebook norm, supporting crisp, clean images of 1024x768 resolution. For your listening enjoyment, HP has added a 16-bit Sound Blaster Pro-compatible audio chipset and integrated Altec-Lansing speakers.Controlling the Pavilion ze5375us is a snap. The unit features a full size 88-key keyboard with embedded numeric keypad, a Touch Pad with on/off button, and a dedicated vertical scroll up/down pad. Other amenities include three fast USB 2.0 ports for plug and play peripherals, a single IEEE 1394 port for high-speed interaction with demanding external peripherals such as digital camcorders, and VGA and TV outs. Communication facilities include integrated 802.11 b wireless LAN, an RJ-45 Ethernet jack for fast network and Internet interaction, and a 56K modem for low-speed e-communication.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HW4SWAW6L._SY300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Computers & Accessories,Laptops,,,

Steiner 8x42 Peregrine Binocular,"The optics of the Peregrine measure higher in spectral light transmission across the entire visible light range, on average, than all of our other closest performance competitors. This means you see colors more vibrantly and you can discover and identify species in more difficult settings and situations.The optical glass is manufactured at our new state-of-the-art roof prism glass production facility in Bayreuth, Germany.FocusingThe focus is our rapid close-focus system with left hand diopter adjustment. The precise central focus wheel will go from a close focus of less than 6 feet out to infinity in just one full turn. Any less - the focus would be to sensitive and not precise enough. Any more &#x96; the focus could be too slow. The focus of the Peregrine was designed to give you this perfect balance of speed and precision.Shockproof/WaterproofWe're not just saying it, we practically invented it! As you may already know, Steiner has been in the binocular business for over 55 years now, and has developed numerous innovations which makes binoculars last longer in unfriendly conditions. Early on, we pioneered the use of rubber armoring, and most recently we developed a dry nitrogen purging and pressurization system that absolutely prevents binoculars from fogging internally. We built this purging/pressurized dry nitrogen system into the Peregrine binoculars. They meet and exceed the US government's waterproof /shockproof specification (Mil Std 810 E).",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4172GTNM3BL._SX300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Camera & Photo,Binoculars & Scopes,Binoculars,,

Steiner 10x42 Merlin Binocular,"If you need high performance for faster discovery, especially of birds on the move, take a close look at the new light weight alloy bodied Steiner Merlin 10x42 binocular. This binocular is precise, yet amazingly rugged and also fully waterproofed for even the rainiest days.The optics are made with premium optical glass and are coated with our own natural color transmission multi-coating which boosts light transmission much higher than similar binoculars in this price range and yields extraordinary clarity, resolution and color fidelity.Focusing is our unique ""Fast-Focus"" system which turns from close focus to infinite distance in two full turns of the focus wheel, for razor sharp fine tuning. The focusing is smooth and precise, and it's waterproof.Since birds are skittish by the presence of bright or light colors, Steiner tried the opposite approach with the exterior finish of the Merlin: the almost transparent neutral color on the Merlin is a unique earth tone brown; chosen by Steiner's development staff and birders as a color least noticeable to birds.The Merlin 10x42 has the best brightness and widest field of view of the Merlin Series. This is the best all around size and model for most all birding applications. The brightness and field of view have many benefits, especially in lower light or following birds in flight.What's in the BoxNeoprene neck strap, rain-guard, Objective caps, and case",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41FR6S818BL._SX300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Camera & Photo,Binoculars & Scopes,Binoculars,,

Motorola DCP501 All-In-One Home Theater Receiver,"Motorola's DCP501 home-theater system not only simplifies the hookup of everything from cable TV to VCRs and satellite receivers--it also unifies audio and video media playback and amplification within one easy-to-use device. The DCP501 combines the functions of a digital cable receiver, a DVD/CD/MP3 player, a 100-watts-per-channel surround receiver, and an AM/FM stereo receiver. For DVD viewing with immersive, high-quality surround sound, just add speakers and a television. The plug-n-play unit supports Dolby Digital 5.1, DTS, and Pro Logic II surround formats.For cable reception, the DCP501's 50 to 860 MHz tuner supports clear analog, 64 and 256 QAM clear and encrypted digital cable services. Where available, the tuner is also compatible with Motorola-enabled digital cable services in both two-way and telephone-return cable systems. (It also supports Motorola DCT2000 digital cable applications.) The receiver's high-performance, Tripath Class-T audio amplifiers deliver 100 watts to all five main channels (left, center, right, and left/right surround), while built-in preamplifier outputs let you use the device as a preamplifier with a more powerful stereo or multichannel power amplifier.Extensive inputs and outputs include front-panel audio/video hookups for a camcorder or gaming console, including a Toslink optical input for a direct digital-audio hookup with an external device. Two additional digital-audio inputs are found on the back panel (one each optical and coaxial), and an onboard NTSC decoder uses a digital adaptive comb filter to upconvert all composite-video signals to S-video for use with higher-resolution S-VHS VCRs and compatible TVs.Crucially, any video input source can be converted and/or channeled to any of the three video outputs for maximum convenience when using the DCP501 with a VCR, DVR (digital video recorder), or other device.What's in the BoxDCP501 cable-ready home theater system, a universal remote control, remote batteries, a self-install kit, FM/AM antennas, six-foot composite-video/analog audio interconnect, six-foot S-video cable, six-foot coaxial video cable, and a user's manual.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/412KoYTOrEL._SX300_.jpg,199,,Electronics,Home Audio,Stereo Components,Receivers & Amplifiers,Component Receivers,

Wharfedale LoudMan Portable Stereo Speaker System (Aqua Blue) (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"Lightweight and small enough to fit in your pocket, yet powerful enough to fill a room with sound, the LoudMan portable powered speaker system is all that's needed for a laptop, portable CD player, minidisc, or MP3 device. LoudMan provides superb stereo sound from powered speakers in a shell no bigger than a double-CD case. Wharfedale's use of NXT surface sound technology allows for small, thin speakers whose quality is far superior to the traditional small multimedia units that most people are familiar with. A built-in amplifier will accept a signal from any .125-inch minijack stereo output (cable provided), and dramatically improves listening experience, whether you're listening to a personal stereo with friends, giving a multimedia presentation, playing a games console, or just reviewing your latest MP3 downloads.LoudMan uses innovative NXT technology to produce a diffuse sound. Rather than producing directional, coherent waves like standard stereo loudspeakers, NXT panels produce sound from their entire surface. This means the sound is more ambient in nature, having a number of significant benefits, including a more even sound pattern throughout the room. The sound doesn't get louder and quieter as traditional loudspeakers do when you move in and out of their interference patterns. Rather, each listener will hear the same sound, wherever they are in the vicinity.Supplied complete with a built-in low-consumption amplifier, the LoudMan can be battery powered (it uses 4 AA batteries, supplied) or used with an optional 6V DC adapter. The LoudMan carrying case stores one LoudMan system, a connecting cable, and six compact discs.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41TN7W7BE5L._SX300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Portable Audio & Video,MP3 Players & Accessories,MP3 Player Accessories,Speaker Systems,

MINOLTA Dimage F100 Digital Camera,"So stylish, yet so powerful...the Minolta DiMage F100 brings you high-quality imaging and innovative features such as high-quality Minolta GT lens, the world's first Area AF with Subject Tracking AF, the world's first Automatic Digital Subject Program Selection, 3x optical zoom and 2.5x seamless digital, and high-level creative imaging.Minolta's exclusive Area AFWith many advanced digital cameras, a half-press of the shutter will start focus lock. But with the DiMage F100, capturing in-focus images is even easier. Thanks to the amazing Minolta-developed Area AF, you can just point the camera and shoot--no focus lock is required. Area AF will automatically detects your subject within its extra-wide focusing area, and deliver optimum results.Subject Tracking AFThe DiMage F100 is the first digital camera with a built-in lens to offer the Area AF with Subject Tracking AF. Subject Tracking AF is a feature that keeps great photo opportunities from passing you by. That's because it automatically follows the movement of your subject within the autofocus area, switching the active focusing block to make sure the subject stays sharp. This feature is activated with a half-press of the shutter button, and it continues until you press the button all the way down to capture the image.Rapid autofocusCamera response is further enhanced by rapid autofocusing. This speedy operation is the product of ultra-fast ASIC circuitry, a sophisticated focusing algorithm, and quick lens adjustment. It leads to focusing speeds of approximately 0.35 seconds at the widest lens angle and approximately 0.5 seconds in telephoto (1 meter).World's first Automatic Digital Subject Program SelectionAnother feature making its first appearance in a digital camera, Automatic Digital Subject Program Selection, makes it easier than ever to get correct exposures in various situations. Just leave the DiMage F100 in Auto mode, and exposure is adjusted automatically to match the scene: portrait, night portrait, landscape, sunset, or sports action. The LCD monitor displays an icon to tell you which mode is active. Macro mode is also provided as a manual setting.PortraitAdjustments are made to obtain soft skin tones, and your subject is made prominent through a shallow depth of field.SportsShutter speed is quickened to ensure that a moving subject stays in focus.LandscapeBoth your subject and the background are in sharp focus. Ideal for taking pictures of friends in front of a landmark or other interesting location.SunsetRed value is heightened to faithfully capture the scene.Night View/Night PortraitColors under artificial light are reproduced accurately, and slow-shutter sync is used during flash shooting.Macro Mode (manual setting) is additionally providedThis mode lets you take impressive close-ups from as close as 5.7 inches from the lens.Superfine 4-megapixel imagesTake the quick and easy route to high-quality images with the stylish DiMage F100. It captures sharp, detail-rich images with 4.0 million effective pixels. At this level of resolution, you can turn your shots into photo-quality that are larger than postcard, or even clear B4-size enlargements (approximately 15.2 x 11.4 inches, 150dpi).High-quality Minolta GT lens (38-114mm)The Minolta GT Lens has been specially designed for use with digital cameras, allowing the DiMage F100 to maximize the power of the CCD. It is an ultra-compact lens system with 3x optical zoom, and is comprised of 8 elements arranged in 7 groups. Among these elements are 3 aspherical lenses that minimize chromatic aberration and reduce distortion along the outer parts of an image.Clearer colors through Minolta CxProcessIf you're interested in images with true-to-life color, then Minolta CxProcess has just what you're looking for. This exclusive image processing technology strikes a balance between sharpness, tonal gradation, and other factors to create remarkably natural colors that reflect your original impression of the captured scene.7.5x zoom (3x optical and 2.5x seamless digital)A wide zoom range is an essential tool for framing the shot you're looking for. That's why the DiMage F100 offers 3X optical zoom, with a range covering the equivalent of 38 to 114mm on a 35mm film camera. And when you're at the limit of optical zoom, the camera shifts seamlessly into digital zoom, which provides an added 2.5x magnification. This gives you a total zoom range of 7.5x, and a telescopic 285mm (equivalent) focal length as your maximum.Fast, stress-free operationThe DiMage F100 is ready for action right away thanks to its ultra-fast ASIC circuitry. And, as you're shooting, autofocusing is very fast. Checking your images is also hassle-free.Movie recordingWhy settle for still pictures alone? The DiMage F100 lets you record movies up to 35 seconds long, complete with audio. You can play back a movie on the camera's LCD monitor, or connect the camera to your TV and enjoy it on the big screen. Movie files are recorded in Motion JPEG format (320 x 240 pixels).Voice recordingThe DiMage F100 is also equipped with audio-only recording, which can be a convenient tool for taking notes. A single clip can be 30 minutes long, and is stored as an 8-bit uncompressed Wave file. Playback is not included.Audio captioningKeep a record of where and when you took a particular shot by adding an audio caption to it. Captions are recorded after image capture, and can be 5 or 15 seconds long.Ergonomic designFrom the overall shape to its various controls, the DiMage F100 puts a lot of emphasis on comfortable use. First, the lightweight and level contour body makes it easy to carry around and to hold as you capture images. Next, camera controls are positioned in a way that supports easy, intuitive operation. Controls include a user-friendly four-way control key and a big function dial for switching between modes. And, to make shooting more enjoyable, you can set the DiMage F100 to emit the sounds of a traditional film camera, like the shutter click of a Minolta SLR or the nostalgic Minolta CLE.Simple PC data transferSD Memory CardThis camera uses tiny memory cards (SD memory card or MultiMediaCard) to store your images as you're capturing them. And when you're ready to transfer data to your PC, the Universal Serial Bus (USB) interface gets things done in no time at all. USB supports Hot Plug and Play for ease of use, so you can hook up the camera whenever your PC is on.E-mail Copy for easy resizingAt full size, a 4-megapixel image is much too large for displaying on a PC monitor. So if you want to share a great picture with someone, just use the handy E-mail Copy feature, which resizes any image to a trim, emailable size (640-by-480 pixels). E-mail Copy lets you do this through the camera itself, instead of on a PC.Versatile built-in flashThe built-in flash features a TTL (through-the-lens) flash metering system, and has a variety of selectable flash modes. When the camera is set to Auto, you have four modes to choose from: auto, manual fill-flash, red eye reduction, and flash cancel.What's in the Box:DiMage F100, battery (CR-V3), hand strap (HS-DG100), SD memory card (16MB), AV cable (AVC-200), USB cable (USB-500), DiMage software CD-ROM.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ER4WEED9L._SY300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Camera & Photo,Digital Cameras,Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,,

Hitachi DZMV350A MiniDVD Camcorder with 2.5&quot; LCD and Digital Still Capability,"Hitachi has single-handedly changed home movies forever. These  camcorders record directly on to a DVD disc so you can access instantly any  scene on the disc, resulting in savings endless hours of rewinding and  fast-forwarding.This camcorder can fit into your pocket, similar to a traditional size still  camera. You even have a choice as to how you record your memories.With the introduction of the world's first DVD camcorder, Hitachi has  advanced the world of home video recording. In fact, Hitachi won an Emmy  from the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences for this accomplishment.  Instead of tape, the DVD Camcorder records to an 8cm optical DVD disc. It  automatically writes to blank areas of the disc, with no worry of accidental  erasure. You have direct access to any scene or still photo on the disc-no  frantic fast-forwarding or rewinding to play back what you've just recorded.DVD-RAM allows you to record and erase scenes on a disc as many as 100,000  times, about average for most doting dads. Each recording is stored as a  scene that you can edit, apply special transitions to, and compile with  other scenes into custom playlists. All performed within the camera. You can even record in DVD-R, a write-once format, so you can remove the  disc from the camera and play it back on your home DVD player.Because you can record directly to DVD, remove the disc and play it back on  a home DVD player (even mail it to friends or family), you can easily share  your important moments with family and friends. This dual format DVD  camcorder offers both DVD-RAM and DVD-R recording and playback, as well as  the capability to shoot and store nearly 2,000 still photos plus an SD card  capability. The Disc Navigation feature not only enables direct access to  any scene or photo, but provides a host of in-camera editing functions. With  the optional PC Kit, video can be uploaded to your PC, where you can author  your own DVD movies and burn them back to DVD-R on the camcorder.Product HighlightsRecords on DVD:No more tapes, no accidental erasure of  previously-recorded materialDVD-RAM Format:Record, erase and re-record on same disc up to  100,000 timesDVD-R Format:Compatible for instant playback, on most home DVD  playersUp to 2 Hours of Recording:Significantly longer than digital  videotapeStill Photo Mode Plus SD Card:Takes up to 1,998 still photos  (DVD-RAM)Disc Navigation:Enables direct, immediate access to any scene,  plus a host of in-camera editing featuresAdvanced Stable Pix Electronic Image Stabilization:Produces  smoother shots during camcorder movement2.5"" Color LCD panel:Provides a clear picture during shooting",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21KG2EMJ57L.jpg,,,Electronics,Camera & Photo,Video,Camcorders,,

SONY KLV-30XBR900 30&quot; LCD WEGA Flat Panel Television,"Equipped with an abundance of high-end features, the Sony KLV-30XBR900 TV is sleek and satisfying, employing a space-saving 30-inch flat panel design that looks comfortable in any environment. The screen offers a wide 170-degree viewing angle, letting visitors watch TV from nearly any corner of the room. It's the video attributes that really set this TV apart, however. The TV comes with an HD media receiver, which plays 720p and 1080i high-definition modes right out of the box. The TV also includes a rear DVI-HDTV interface that connects to other HD set-top boxes, while its 1,280 x 768 display makes a perfect match for the superior video output of progressive scan DVD players.The 30-inch TV incorporates Sony's proprietary WEGA Engine, which minimizes the number of digital-to-analog conversion processes, thereby maximizing image clarity and performance. Included in the WEGA digital package is Direct Digital circuitry, which improves the signal-to-noise ratio when converting from analog to digital, and CineMotion, which automatically detects film content and converts it via the 3:2 pulldown process to deliver more accurate, smoother-looking DVD images. The TV also employs MID-X (Multi-Image Driver), a feature that works in concert with the dual NTSC tuner to display two programs from two different sources (1080i, 720p, 480p, and 480i) on the same screen.Digital photographers will appreciate the Memory Stick slot, which accepts Memory Sticks from digital cameras and camcorders and then displays still JPEG images in traditional or slide-show format. As with many high-end TVs, the KLV-30XBR900 also offers several widescreen modes, letting users enjoy 4:3 broadcasts in zoom, full, and wide zoom formats. The built-in stereo speakers (10 watts x 2) and TruSurround SRS audio effect--which simulates a surround environment in a two-speaker setup--amplify the TV's audio package. The TV also includes such user favorites as a sleep timer, V-Chip parental control, and a favorite channel option.Connectivity is rich and varied, with two rear component video inputs, one front and two rear S-video inputs, one front and two rear composite inputs, one rear DVI-HDTV interface, one front and five rear audio inputs, one rear Control-S output, and a subwoofer output. The component video inputs deliver the highest-quality picture through DVD players, while the S-video and composite inputs ensure compatibility with virtually any video source, including VCRs, camcorders, game systems, and more.What's in the BoxTV, media receiver, remote control, two AAA batteries, two AC power cords, display interface cable, antenna cable, user's manual",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41MRZ8DX9YL._SY300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Television & Video,Televisions,LCD TVs,,

This 7.5x-power Epoch Full-Size is equipped with 43mm objective lenses made of SF prism glass, the highest grade of glass available. Brunton also fitted the lenses in a magnesium alloy frame so durable that it can withstand the most rigorous tests imaginable. Perhaps the most unique development, however, is Brunton's Variable Speed Focus System, which makes all other focus wheels seem inferior. The binocular acquires targets from 30 feet out to infinity with only a minimal turn of the focus wheel, and can adjust to objects a mere 36 inches away for a close-in look. These building blocks, combined with a multitude of other innovations, have taken the Epoch Full-Size to the pinnacle of optical design and engineering. These binoculars are great for everything from hunting to hiking.Specifications include a locking, 20mm multi-step eye relief system that's eyeglass compatible, a 370-foot field of view at 1,000 yards, and a 5.7mm exit pupil. The list of coatings is nearly as impressive, with state-of-the-art phase coating, a FlatLight full multi-coating, an anti-fog lens coating, and an AL-HR reflective coating all contributing to the crisp resolution.Additional features include a diopter adjustment mechanism that locks in so your vision is always crisp, a tripod adapter, a comfortable neck strap, and a soft leather case for carrying.

Boasting a smaller range than many of Uniden's other two-way radios, the TR622s are particularly ideal for casual communications, such as keeping in touch with pals at the ballpark, rather than strenuous activities that might require a lifesaving response.Each radio features 22 channels (8 GMRS and 14 FRS) and 38 CTCSS privacy codes, ensuring that you can almost always talk with friends or family via an exclusive, uninterrupted signal (radios must be set on the same channel and code to communicate). It's easy to browse for channels thanks to the channel scan feature, which looks for active signals while you view the display, and the monitor function, which listens for weak signals on a given frequency. And talking on the radio couldn't be simpler--just hit the PTT button when you're ready to transmit. It's important to note that the transmission range will vary depending on the channel and the surrounding terrain.The radios also include such features as a backlit LCD display with a battery strength meter, a keypad lock that keeps you from accidentally pressing buttons at the wrong time (such as when a radio is in your pocket), and five selectable call tones. And no worries about running out of power too quickly, as the radios come with NiMH battery packs and a dual charging cradle, which keep the radios humming for around 15 hours per charge (the radios also work with four AAA batteries). The entire bundle, which includes a pair of belt clips for efficient transport, is backed by a one-year warranty on parts and labor.What's in the BoxTwo TR622 two-way radios, dual charging cradle with AC adapter, two rechargeable NiMH batteries, two belt clips, user's manual.Note: Use of the General Mobile Radio Service (GMRS) frequencies requires a Federal Communication Commission license.

Creative Labs TravelSound MP3 (1-Piece Portable Speaker with 32 MB Memory),"Creative Labs' TravelSound MP3 portable music player is an all-in-one MP3 player, voice recorder, and portable storage device with twin 1-inch Titanium micro drivers--no headphones required (though you can add your own if you wish). Compact, lightweight, and versatile, the device is perfect for mobile executives, students, or homemakers. Its clear sound and flexible uses make it ideal for business presentations or simply augmenting a leisure picnic in park.As an MP3 music player (compatible with 32 to 320 kbps files), the TravelSound MP3 offers 32 MB built-in memory that lets you store and play up to an hour of your favorite music. It also offers a SmartMedia reader compatible with cards offering up to 128 MB, providing an additional 4 hours of music. You can also use the unit as a portable storage device to transport audio and data files.The 2 built-in titanium drivers are firm and lightweight for optimal clarity and accuracy. The unit's tiny digital amplifier requires only a third the power of conventional linear amplifiers, resulting in great sound and extended battery life.Conventional linear amplifiers are normally less efficient and require more power to deliver the audio output. This extra power is generated as heat, requiring heat sinks to dissipate it. And this means larger speakers. The TravelSound's efficient digital amplifier requires less power to produce a given audio output. This means less heat and therefore a smaller enclosure and longer battery life.You'll enjoy up to 12 hours of listening to your favorite MP3 music on 4 alkaline batteries (supplied) or up to 20 hours playback using direct line-in amplification. At the press of a button, a wide effect expands the perceived soundstage produced by the 6-inch wide device.Use the built-in microphone as your convenient recorder for interviews, lectures, or personal notes, with up to 2 hours of recording on one set of batteries.It's a snap to transfer digital music and other files between your PC and the TravelSound MP3. Hook it up via USB 1.1 and the TravelSound shows up as an additional drive on your desktop to which you can conveniently move (and extract) files at up to 12 Mbps.Store and protect your TravelSound MP3 with the included carrying case, and power it using the supplied batteries or an optional universal power adapter (sold separately).What's in the BoxTravelSound MP3 player, quick-start guide, an installation CD, 4 AAA batteries, a carrying case, USB cable, and a stereo analog .125-inch minijack-to-minijack interconnect.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41F19A67VJL._SX300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Portable Audio & Video,MP3 Players & Accessories,MP3 Player Accessories,Speaker Systems,

The S-650's controls are designed around the multipurpose jog wheels (one for each deck), which DJs can use to create cue points, rapidly search through a specific track, or bend the pitch to create a quicker or slower tempo (the pitch bends up to +/- 16 percent).DJs will also appreciate such features as track sequence programming (for creating custom arrangements of 30 or fewer tracks per deck), relay playback, a sleep mode that preserves the lifespan of the laser, and standard repeat one and all modes. And DJs aren't restricted to prerecorded CDs, as the S-650 also supports CD-R discs burned on a home computer. Plus, the CD player includes a buffer memory with 20 seconds of anti-shock protection on each side to prevent disruptions from dance-floor bumps or jostles.The rack-mountable CD player, which boasts digital outputs for the best possible sound, measures 19 by 3.5 by 10 inches (W x H x D) and carries a one-year warranty on parts and labor.

Progressive scanning, referred to as 480p for the number of horizontal lines that compose the video image, creates a picture using twice the scan lines of a conventional DVD picture, providing higher resolution and sharper images while eliminating nearly all motion artifacts.The DVD727 also performs 3:2 pulldown.

The satellite speakers, each featuring a minicube design with cloth grilles, are magnetically shielded to prevent video interference.The system incorporates many of the premier features of home theater technology, including progressive scan, which produces a better picture by completely scanning each movie frame (rather than interlacing frames), and compatibility with Dolby Digital, DTS, and Pro Logic II formats. The DSTP582 also employs discrete audio channels for superior audio, along with JVC's exclusive digital acoustic processor, which enables the receiver to digitally re-create the acoustic environments of live performances.

Toshiba 51H83 51-Inch HDTV-Ready TheaterWide Projection TV,"Note: Toshiba 51H83 51"" HDTV-Ready TheaterWide Projection TV is no longer being manufactured. You may want to consider purchasing the newerToshiba 51H84 51"" HD-Ready Rear-Projection TV with HDMI Inputinstead.Blazing forth with its huge screen, high style, and bountiful high-tech features, Toshiba's 51H83 TheaterWide HDTV projection monitor is set to render vivid, smooth, and detailed video signals from DVD players, digital TV set-top boxes, digital satellite systems, cable television boxes--you name it. The set's TruView feature combines several enhancements (black level expansion, fine white, flesh tone correction, and color detail enhancer) to automatically display accurate picture and color details. Also automated, HD Dynamic Contrast continually analyzes picture information and sharpens and deepens those parts of the picture with the most detailed information.And since not everything you watch will be high-definition in origin (wouldn'tthatbe nice), CrystalScan HDSC upconverts all video signals (including 480i/p) to 1080i HD. This significantly reduces jagged-line artifacts for a smoother, more natural image. (Selectable 540p, for those who want a progressive-scan image from a progressive-scan source, is available through the onscreen menu.) CableClear DNR+ Digital Noise Reduction circuitry optimizes poor NTSC signals from antenna or cable by eliminating video noise (snow).Meanwhile, DFine high-speed velocity-scan modulation improves the definition at picture edges, creating sharper images by slowing the CRT (cathode-ray tube) beam's horizontal scanning during demanding work--say, when rendering transitions from light to dark parts of an image--and speeding it up when scanning easily rendered sections, like broad dark areas.A 3D Y/C (4 MB, 10-bit) digital comb filter with Vertical Contour Correction processes RF and composite-video signals for a sharp, clean picture. This advanced filter significantly reduces detail noise, seen as shimmering or flicker, in complex or intricate scenes. The TouchFocus digital convergence system creates perfect corner-to-corner focus at the press of a button.Cinema Mode (3:2 pulldown) circuitry identifies film-based content from DVDs and reassembles the frame sequence to more accurately reproduce a movie's original 24-frame rate. This process eliminates artifacts and gives you sharp, accurate full-frame progressive images.Finally, the set's TheaterFine HD super fine-pitch screen uses a 0.52 mm design to reduce the space between lines on the lenticular screen, thereby sharpening the image. With convenient direct video input selection, you can choose specific inputs right from the remote's numbered keypad--no more scrolling through all the inputs to find the one you want.The 51H83 is loaded with connections of all stripes, including a DVI HDTV input, which gives you a pure, uncompressed video connection with your DTV receiver or set-top box (not included).For audio, the 20-watts-per-channel 51H83 offers SRS WOW, combining SRS 3D (which creates a wide three-dimensional sound field), TruBass (which boosts bass frequency perception for dramatic low-frequency effects), and Focus (which raises the perceived sound image vertically to clarify voices) to greatly enhance your home-theater sound. StableSound maintains television volume within a preset range regardless of the source signal, and Toshiba's Sub Bass System (SBS) boosts a program's low-end audio for heightened dramatic impact.The supplied illuminated universal remote also controls most manufacturers' VCRs and DVD players.What's in the BoxTV, cabinet, remote control, batteries, user's manual, and warranty information.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41TZ0VWPCPL._SY300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Television & Video,Televisions,LCD TVs,,

The system also features built-in Dolby Digital, DTS, and Dolby Pro Logic II 5.1-channel surround processing with a multichannel surround speaker setup to envelop you in luscious sound from movies and music. You can even play your recordable CDs filled with MP3 files or JPEG digital photos.For thunderous sound at loud levels and clear, full-bodied sound at quiet levels, the TH-M55 pumps out 100 watts x 5 (front left/right, center, left/right surrounds), and comes with a stand-alone 120-watt powered subwoofer.The TH-M55's high-resolution component-video output delivers the best possible video reproduction to compatible high-definition and HD-ready televisions and monitors, while an optical digital-audio input accommodates stereo and multichannel audio feeds from digital satellite systems and DTV set-top boxes.Progressive scanning, referred to as 480p for the number of horizontal lines that compose the video image, creates a picture using twice the scan lines of a conventional DVD picture, giving you higher resolution and sharper images while eliminating nearly all motion artifacts. The Direct Digital Progressive Scan feature is defeatable so you can use the component-video outputs with non-HD-ready compatible TVs. Composite- and S-video jacks facilitate hookup with most other sets in use today.The system's front, center, and rear satellites use a 2-way design, each incorporating a 4-inch woofer and a tweeter housed in a real-wood cabinet. The powered subwoofer pounds out the low-frequency effects for your 5.1-channel DVDs and Dolby Pro Logic II-processed music using a single 6.3-inch driver and a ported, bass-reflex cabinet.A 4-mode digital acoustic processor (DAP) simulates different sonic environments, which you can adjust on a program-by-program basis. The onboard digital FM/AM tuner offers 45 station presets (30 FM and 15 AM), and the supplied full-function remote control also operates most brands of TV and VCR.

More significantly, the device is also compatible with MP3 files recorded on a CD-R disc, giving you access to far more of your digital music catalog. To support the MP3 functionality, RCA included its SmartTrax navigation technology, which helps you quickly access specific MP3 songs or playlists using a library of computer-generated ID tags that identify digital audio files by title, artist, album, year, genre and track number. The SmartTrax file management system can even ""read"" song data from your recordable CDs, letting you view track names and create playlists at the touch of a button.The five-disc changer, meanwhile, boasts such features as 32-track programming, CD-R and CD-RW compatibility, intro scan, random play, and repeat play (for one track, one disc, and all discs).

Toshiba 20AF43 20&quot; Flat Screen TV,"Enjoy vivid, high-contrast pictures from Toshiba's 20-inch FST PURE flat picture tube. Affordable, stylish, and loaded with features, the 20AF43 makes a great upgrade to a DVD or satellite-based home theater. The set's FST PURE flat tube eliminates intrusive reflections from ambient light relative to conventional CRT designs and broadens the angles from which the screen may be viewed.The 20AF43's three-line digital comb filter and vertical contour correction further enhance resolution by removing blurred edges between colors and reducing dot crawl (tiny, moving dots of color along a sharp color separation in a vertical line, as in a depiction of a character's striped T-shirt).Meanwhile, velocity-scan modulation improves the definition at picture edges, creating sharper images by slowing the CRT (cathode-ray tube) beam's horizontal scanning during demanding work--say, when rendering transitions from light to dark parts of an image--and speeding it up when scanning easily rendered sections, like broad dark areas. Another technology, black-level expansion, improves contrast (which results in a sharper, more three-dimensional picture).The set provides stereo reception (with five watts per channel) and SAP (second audio program), which is often used to broadcast an alternate-language track. The 20AF43 derives a heightened sense of stereo separation from its double-baffle speaker system, and BBE High-Definition Sound improves speech intelligibility and restores the dynamic range of compressed musical passages.A ColorStream component-video input provides the ultimate picture quality from interlaced component-video signals; standard composite-video inputs accommodate all DVD players and most other video sources. You get two sets of rear AV inputs (one with S-video) as well as one set of front AV inputs for easy connection with a camcorder or gaming console.

The player runs on either alkaline or rechargeable batteries (both not included.) With the low battery alert, keeping ahead of run-down batteries is a cinch. Whether playing CDs or MP3 discs, alkaline batteries will last for approximately twenty hours. With the forty-five second CD anti-skip protection (120 seconds for MP3 files), the XL-PM25 is a good choice for runners and walkers. The anti-shock system also might interest users who will use the player in conjunction with a vehicle's cassette player.

The sixty-four track programmable memory will allow a listener to individualize a MP3-formatted CD, perfect for an extra hard workout. Additionally, if you connect the player to a stereo, the sixty-four programmed tracks will keep you listening for quite a few hours.

Sony DCRPC105 MiniDV 1.0 Mega Pixel Handycam Camcorder with 2.5&quot; Swivel LCD,"Amazon.com Product Description The Sony DCR-PC105 goes beyond a regular video camcorder by being equipped with useful technological additions, such as a 1-megapixel digital camera and MPEG movie mode. The camcorder also features a 10x optical zoom, 2.5-inch LCD with touch panel control, color viewfinder, and USB streaming capabilities.Step-up ValueHere's a Sony feature that adds value to this digital camcorder and differentiates it from other models in the Sony lineup.Carl Zeiss Vario-Sonnar Lens:Famous for its superior sharpness and color accuracy, the Vario-Sonnar lens is the most advanced multi-layer optical coating system. The Carl Zeiss optical zoom brings the action close up from far away. In addition, precision digital zoom interpolation technology means that extreme digital zooming is clearer, with less distortion than previous types of digital zoom.Image StabilizationSony's SteadyShot picture stabilization keeps your images smooth and steady without degrading picture quality. The technology uses motion sensors, which tends to be more accurate than most other systems used in the camcorder market.OpticsThe multi-coated Carl Zeiss Vario-Sonnar lens ensures light capture will be well-contrasted and clear. The 1/4.7-inch advanced HAD CCD sensor accurately records images in vibrant color and sharp resolution. The PC105 has a robust 10x optical zoom that fits most purposes, but for extra distance the camera can reach 120x through the digital zoom. You can choose from three focusing systems to keep your images sharp and in focus: full range auto, manual, and spot focusing.More FeaturesYou can record video in low to no light situations with Sony's NightShot system, which uses infrared light to capture images invisible to the human eye. With the function on, subjects up to 10 feet away can be seen in total darkness. You can also use the color slow shutter for color night shots instead of the regular green night shot hue.Sony's Stamina power management system and InfoLithium battery give the PC105 a long operating time. To keep you informed of current battery life, Sony's AccuPower meter displays the number of minutes remaining right in the viewfinder.You can take digital stills and record small MPEG EX movies using the included 8 MB Memory Stick. This is where the 1 megapixel resolution CCD really shines, creating images with vibrant color and detail. The intelligent pop-up flash keeps your images well-lit and visible.The PC105 features an easy to see 2.5-inch color LCD and a color viewfinder. The screen's image can still be easily seen even in broad daylight with the use of the LCD backlight. The menu is accessed via a touch screen display on the LCD, reducing the clutter of buttons on the camera.The USB port can be used to bring in your stills onto the computer or stream video to make the camcorder function as a video conferencing tool or webcam. The IEEE1394 (Firewire) connection can be used for digital video editing on a computer, and S-Video and AV connections are also present for direct viewing on a television or VHS dubbing.MiniDV FormatMiniDV is the new preferred format for personal and broadcast-quality video, highly regarded for its high audio and image quality. With up to 540 lines of horizontal resolution and minimum color noise, MiniDV delivers a 20 percent clearer picture than analog camcorder formats. This is all delivered on a cassette that's 1/12th the size of a standard VHS tape. A MiniDV tape offers digital recording time of 2 full hours--20 times the capacity of a CD.ContentsThis package includes the PC105 camcorder, power adaptor/in-camera charger, InfoLithium rechargeable battery, 8 MB Memory Stick, wireless remote with 2 AA batteries, AV cable, lens cap, shoulder strap, USB cable, USB drivers, and LCD cleaning cloth.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SSY0GSKGL._SY300_.jpg,13.49,,Electronics,Camera & Photo,Video,Camcorders,,

Samsung LTN406W 40-Inch LCD Flat-Panel HD-Ready TV,"Early Adopters Pick: May 2003Samsung's LTN406W is the world's largest LCD TV.Samsung's 40-inch high-resolution widescreen LCD television is not only a gigantic LCD screen TV, it's also the answer to all your home entertainment needs, from its PC, DVD, and DTV inputs to its built-in NTSC tuner and integrated stereo speakers with 10 watts power each. At less than three inches deep, the set is nothing if not easy to place, its slim profile lending its massive screen width to even small rooms.The LTN406W is a TFT active-matrix HDTV monitor with 1,280 x 768 resolution. TFT (Thin Film Technology) gives every pixel its own identity, so they can rapidly switch shades while maintaining some of the best brightness and contrast levels available. Image quality is enhanced by a 3D digital comb filter, an extremely high (600:1) contrast ratio, an exceptional peak brightness of 500 candles/square meter, and wide (170 x 170-degrees) viewing angles. Samsung also includes its proprietary video-enhancment technology, Digital Natural Image engine (DNIe). DNIe performs 3-D noise reduction and detail and contrast enhancement for all interlaced (non-HD) sources. Throw in 60,000-hour lamp life for years of use and PC and multi-channel picture-in-picture with split-screen capabilities, and you're looking at a sweet little--make that sweet big--set.Connections include one S-video input, one composite-video input, an RF input (for older VCRs and cable boxes), and two component-video inputs (one progressive-scan DVD-oriented 480i video input, one DTV-ready 480p/720p/1080i input), as well as a DVI input (with HDCP content protection) for a PC. A headphone jack affords private listening, and Virtual Dolby surround sound simulates surround sound from any two speakers. The set includes wall and ceiling mounting hardware.More about DNIeThe Digital Natural Image engine (DNIe) can take a signal from any kind of source--not just conventional or high-definition digital broadcasting, but even DVD, Camcorder, PC and games--and turn it into a stunning picture on any kind of screen. The input signal passes through a series of four advanced processes that form the core of the DNIe technology.The first of these processes, the Motion Optimizer, is responsible for noise reduction. the visual data are automatically broken down into signal and noise and analyzed through a combined spatial/temporal process. DNIe&#145;s noise reduction technology permits a startling level of sharpness even in minute details and rapidly changing scenes. Unlike conventional noise reduction methods, the Motion Optimizer combines a motion adaptive temporal filter, which detects and reduces noise in the temporal space between successive frames, with spatial noise reduction applied to the two-dimensional image space.After passing through the Motion Optimizer,the visual signal is sent to the Contrast Enhancer. This process automatically adjusts contrast and brightness to natural levels, producing an extraordinarily rich and vivid picture. In scenes of motion or rapid change,a separate contrast value should ideally be set for each visual signal, but this presents great technological difficulties. DNIe&#146;s Contrast Enhancer process has overcome these difficulties by applying over 1 million criteria for contrast and automatically determining the optimum contrast level for any kind of visual data. The Contrast Enhancer can also analyze up to 70,000 local images within a frame to preserve contrast in the smallest details without affecting overall color or brightness.The next step in the signal's journey from input to high-quality output is the Detail Enhancer. DNIe's Detail Enhancer uses its own specially developed technology to dramatically improve sharpness just where it matters. The slightly unnatural appearance that results from conventional uniform detail enhancement is re-detected and re-adjusted to produce a strikingly sharp and convincing image. Conventional detail enhancement is based on the artificial amplification of the input signal, but this inevitably produces small areas of noise boost-up and flicker.The final process undergone by the input signal is the Color Optimizer. For each scene, the Color Optimizer analyzes the hues of the input signal to determine and preserve the overall level of brightness. The colors are adjusted and improved, without unnatural intensification, to give vivid tones corresponding to the living shades of nature. By calculating the color saturation of red, green, and blue in each scene, the colors are optimized to the shades that the human eye accepts as natural.What's in the BoxTV, remote control, remote batteries, user's manual, and warranty information.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51P8HKFAYAL._SY300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Television & Video,Televisions,LCD TVs,,
Toshiba 24AF43 24&quot; Flat Screen TV,"Enjoy vivid, high-contrast pictures from Toshiba's 24-inch FST PURE flat picture tube. Affordable, stylish, and loaded with features, the 24AF43 makes a great upgrade to a DVD or satellite-based home theater. The set's FST PURE flat tube eliminates intrusive reflections from ambient light relative to conventional CRT designs and broadens the angles from which the screen may be viewed.The 24AF43's three-line digital comb filter and vertical contour correction further enhance resolution by removing blurred edges between colors and reducing dot crawl (tiny, moving dots of color along a sharp color separation in a vertical line, as in a depiction of a character's striped T-shirt).Meanwhile, velocity-scan modulation improves the definition at picture edges, creating sharper images by slowing the CRT (cathode-ray tube) beam's horizontal scanning during demanding work--say, when rendering transitions from light to dark parts of an image--and speeding it up when scanning easily rendered sections, like broad dark areas. Another technology, black-level expansion, improves contrast (which results in a sharper, more three-dimensional picture).The set provides stereo reception (with five watts per channel) and SAP (second audio program), which is often used to broadcast an alternate-language track. The 24AF43 derives a heightened sense of stereo separation from its double-baffle speaker system, and BBE High-Definition Sound improves speech intelligibility and restores the dynamic range of compressed musical passages.A ColorStream component-video input provides the ultimate picture quality from interlaced component-video signals; standard composite-video inputs accommodate all DVD players and most other video sources. You get two sets of rear AV inputs (one with S-video) as well as one set of front AV inputs for easy connection with a camcorder or gaming console. A rear AV output lets you hook the set up with a surround receiver. The 24AF43 also features V-chip parental controls, a sleep timer, channel lock, GameTimer, and a glow-in-the-dark universal remote control.What's in the BoxTelevision, remote control, batteries, user's manual, warranty information.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5107W6B5C4L._SX300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Accessories & Supplies,Audio & Video Accessories,TV Accessories & Parts,TV Ceiling & Wall Mounts,

Panasonic SC-MT1 DVD-Audio/DVD-Video Home Theater System (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"Specializing in both high-resolution multichannel audio performance and high-quality video playback, Panasonic's SC-MT1 makes the most of your digital media while saving you space and hookup headaches. The system performs surround-sound decoding, amplification, and playback through a specially matched six-speaker system (left, center, right, left and right surround, and low-frequency subwoofer). Its versatility with media playback--from DVD-Video and DVD-Audio to MP3/WMA CDs and JPEG image CDs--means you're never far from your favorite movies, music, or digital photos.DVD-Audio playback offers super-high-fidelity (192 kHz/24-bit) sound derived from special mixes and new masterings of many new and ""catalog"" music titles. DVD-Audio discs typically provide a choice of multichannel and stereo sound, incredible storage capacity, and unique bonus materials not available on regular audio CDs.Your DVD movies will look and sound great through the system's 54 MHz/10-bit video decoder, video depth enhancer, progressive-scan video output (for use with high-definition and HD-ready televisions), and Dolby Digital and DTS discrete 5.1-channel surround decoding and rendering. Progressive scanning, referred to as 480p for the number of horizontal lines that compose the video image, creates a picture using twice the scan lines of a conventional DVD picture, giving you higher resolution and sharper images while eliminating nearly all motion artifacts. This feature can only be appreciated on high-definition and HD-ready TVs.The speaker set includes four bookshelf-sized satellite speakers (front and rear left and right) powered by 30 watts each, a 110-watt center-channel speaker (critical for handling most of a movie's dialogue and sound effects), and a powerful, 140-watt subwoofer optimized for unobtrusive placement. All speakers are magnetically shielded to protect your TV from distortion induced by the speakers' magnetic fields. A digital-synthesized FM/AM tuner lets you listen to your favorite radio stations.What's in the BoxDVD player/integrated surround amplifier, four satellite speakers, a center-channel speaker, a powered subwoofer, a remote control, remote batteries, a user's manual, and all requisite cabling.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31PXKZ4WXKL._SX300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Television & Video,Home Theater Systems,,,

Bratz Beauty Boom Box,"ThisPeople's Choice""Toy of the Year"" is both fashionable and functional. On top of the colorful boom box (13.25 by 10 by 8 inches) is a swiveling CD spinner; turn it over and there's a star-shaped vanity mirror, which is actually more valuable to some. Fuzzy, animal print-covered stereo speakers pump girlish style, and capable sound, into any room. The boom box offers a number of other nice features: programmable memory, auto-repeat, ""mega-bass,"" digital radio tuner, and a power level indicator. There are also two headphone jacks, so friends can jam ""on the down low"" while applying Bratz-inspired makeup techniques in the mirror. Features that are more practicable include a 12-volt input jack/adapter, and a lift-up handle. The handle is great for away-trips, in which case you'll also need 8 ""C"" batteries. It's a happily recommended, award-winning item for girls who love music and expressing a sense of style.--Diane Beall",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NP19ZJEWL._SX300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Portable Audio & Video,Boomboxes,,,

Sealife DC250 2MP Underwater Digital Camera,"The new SeaLife ReefMaster DC250 Digital Camera is the world's first dedicated underwater digital camera. It's rated to 200 feet and can be set to three different exposure programs: Land, Sea & Sea w/ external flash mode. The &#x91;one-button' operation makes it easy to use underwater, just aim and shoot. With virtually no shutter lag, the ReefMaster Digital allows users to capture even the most illusive marine life instantly.The large 1.8 inch LCD makes aiming easy, the rubber armored Easy-Dive System fits just right in your hands. The instant review and delete function practically guarantees great pictures on the spot. With 8MB on board memory, three resolution levels, TTL exposure control, the ReefMaster Digital makes the same clear, crisp images on land as it does at sea.Get long two-hour battery life when using SeaLife 2100 mAh rechargeable NiMH batteries. The DC250 can also be expanded with all SeaLife accessories; macro kit, external flash and wide angle lens. The perfect gift for the warm-water tropical vacationer in your family!SeaLife has customized the camera's firmware to compensate for the difficult light conditions that naturally occur as divers plunge deep below the water's surface.Sea Mode: In the ""Sea"" mode, the shutter speed and aperture adjustments also help compensate for the low lighting conditions common in underwater photography. Setting the camera to the ""Sea"" mode will allow divers and snorkelers to produce exceptional digital images of the fish, coral and shipwreck artifacts they discover during their underwater forays.External Flash Mode: The on-camera flash helps illuminate objects well below the surface, but for photographers who wish to produce more professional results, the ReefMaster Digital is compatible with SeaLife's External Flash unit. No sync cord necessary, because the External Flash is a slave unit activated via the on-cameras flash. To prevent early activation, users set the camera to the ""External Flash"" mode, which de-activates the digital pre-flash.Land Mode: For underwater photographers who also enjoy making digital photography of on-land subjects, the ReefMaster Digital offers a separate operation mode for just that purpose. Simply remove the camera from the Easy-Dive System and set it to ""Land"" mode. This setting allows the ReefMaster Digital to function as a traditional digital camera.Accessories included with the ReefMaster Digital DC250 Camera are:CD with MGI Photo Suite III and PhotoVista SoftwareUSB cableVideo cableCare Kit with anti-fog desiccant cartridgesFull color Quick GuideSoft case for inner camera",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41M7XSABY4L._SY300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Camera & Photo,Underwater Photography,Cameras,,

Sony HTC-800DP Home Theater System (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"Consisting of a space-saving combination DVD player and audio/video receiver powering a complete 5.1-channel speaker package, the 80-watts-per-channel HTC-800DP home theater spins DVD-Video movies as well as recordable CDs with your favorite MP3 music, filling your room with glorious surround sound. The system processes everything from DTS and Dolby Digital 5.1 discrete surround signals to Dolby Pro Logic II, which generates multichannel surround from any stereo source--movie or music. The system's onboard 32-bit surround processor also features Sony's own Digital Cinema Sound System (Cinema Studio EX), broadening your surround listening possibilities.Easy to assemble, the system includes all requisite cabling, and color-coded speaker connections simplify setup so you can enjoy your movies and music as quickly and accurately as possible.Whether your living room is currently home to an HDTV or you're merely thinking of ""someday,"" the HTC-800DP stands ready to deliver the full potential of your DVDs. Progressive scanning, referred to as 480p for the number of horizontal lines that compose the video image, creates a picture using twice the scan lines of a conventional DVD picture, giving you higher resolution and sharper images while eliminating nearly all motion artifacts.A composite-video input offers accompanying analog-audio inputs, accommodating most audio/video components and granting convenient AV switching: just channel the AV signals from your VCR or cable box (for instance) to the receiver, then route a single composite-video cable from the receiver's monitor output to your television.You'll need to supply your own composite- and/or component-video cables, and keep in mind that you'll need both connections in order to appreciate both the progressive-scan feature and the AV switching--the component-video output works only with the DVD image. If you have an older TV you may require a video modulator to convert the receiver's composite-video (yellow RCA jack) signal to an RF signal (which uses a thicker, threaded jack).The included speakers cover left, right, center, and left/right surround, along with a powerful, 100-watt subwoofer with a bass port for added low-frequency slam. A host of radio presets (20 FM, 10 AM) put all your favorite stations (and then some) right at your fingertips, and the receiver's amplifier uses discrete output transistors for clean, quality power.Optional mounting brackets or speaker stands (models WS-WV10D and WS-FV10D, respectively) simplify speaker placement, the assumption being that you'll want to place the center-channel speaker atop your television for optimal dialogue matching. All speakers are magnetically shielded to prevent distortion when placed on or near your TV.What's in the BoxCombination audio/video receiver and DVD player, SS-VE80P speaker package, SA-WMSP80 subwoofer, user's manual, all requisite speaker cable, and Remote Commander remote control.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/416SPKEGBEL._SY300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Television & Video,Home Theater Systems,,,

With ATRAC3plus, music can be burned and compressed at 132, 105, 66, 64, or even 48 kbps (kilobits per second), letting you select the right balance between fidelity and storage space (you'll get around 490 songs per disc at 48 kbps).The player comes bundled with Sony's SonicStage CD Simple Burner software. Compatible with ID3 tagging and most CD burners, this application transfers songs from CDs or MP3 music files from your PC's hard drive and burns them to a CD using ATRAC3plus compression. CD Text and ID3 tag support gives you easy access to CD Text information as well as details like song title, album title, and artist name.Skip-Free G-Protection technology boosts the laser pickup's shock protection to minimize read errors that would otherwise interrupt your music, providing quick recovery from both horizontal and vertical shocks. Bookmark playback lets you program your favorite songs from multiple CDs and play them back at the touch of a button, and CD Text support displays artist and title information with compatible commercial audio CDs.Sony's two-position automatic volume limiter system (AVLS) conserves batteries and guards your hearing by capping your listening level.

Cobra ESD 9870 Radar Detector,"Cobra's ESD 9870 radar and laser detector provides exclusive Cobra functions like Strobe Alert and IntelliMute alongside 360-degree LaserEye detection and conveniences like a digital signal strength meter (which shows your relative proximity to the target) and Cobra's Safety Alert traffic-warning system. Cobra's LaserEye provides 360-degree, 11-band Extra Sensory Detection of laser signals. Its four signals include the LTI 20-20 Laser, the Ultra Lyte Laser, the ProLaser, and the ProLaser III.The ESD 9870 detects all radar (X, K, super-wideband Ka), laser, and safety radar systems. It also provides switchable highway and city modes to prevent false alarms in congested urban areas. Its DigiView data display makes intelligibility a cinch (through its use of easily recognizable text), while EasySet programming menu offers user-friendly mode selection/setting with visual guidance. Further, the unit's Stay Set memory retains all critical settings in non-volatile memory so they'll be there even after a power outage.IntelliMute is a relative-speed-sensing auto-mute system designed to virtually eliminate false alerts. Spectre Alert shows you when you're under surveillance of Spectre radar detector detection, while the Spectre Undetectable mode provides complete immunity to Spectre detection.Strobe Alert works with tens of thousands of emergency vehicles currently equipped with traffic light controlling strobe emitters to provides advanced alert of the presence and/or approach of these vehicles. Safety Alert, meanwhile, warns you of emergency vehicles and road hazards from systems equipped with Safety Alert transmitters.VG-2 Alert lets you know when you're under VG-2 radar surveillance, working alongside VG-2 Undetectable data display to provide complete immunity to VG-2 detection. The city/highway switch lets you manually select an operating mode, reducing the frequency of falsing in densely populated urban areas, and you can dim the detector display to enhance night driving visibility.Other great features include SmartPower (a Cobra exclusive that automatically shuts of power to the unit when ignition is turned off), a digital-signal-strength indicator (which shows relative proximity to a target), voice alert (which gives you specific-band voice announcements), an eight-point electronic compass (which automatically provides an accurate electronic direction reading), and a system-ready prompt (which signifies that the radar detector has correctly completed a self-test and is ready).What's in the BoxRadar detector, windshield bracket, power cord, and a user's manual.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Q878K2WSL._SY300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Car & Vehicle Electronics,Vehicle Electronics Accessories,Radar Detectors,,

"Sony DVP-NC625/B 5-Disc DVD/CD Changer, Black","Why clutter your living room with separate CD and DVD players when you can simply use Sony's five-disc DVP-NC665P/B DVD carousel changer? The unit handles a range of optical media formats, including DVD-Video, DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD+R, and DVD+RW, in addition to MP3 files burned to CD-R/CD-RW discs. Enhance your viewing and listening with features like continuous playback and play exchange (which lets you swap four discs while the fifth is playing), as well as cool enhancements like Sony's Precision Drive 2 system for playing damaged discs.Precision Drive 2 provides a mechanism for reading DVDs that are in less than perfect condition, eliminating errors in playback due to imperfect, scratched, or warped discs. Past generations of Precision Drive technology were only able to compensate for warped discs by moving the entire optical block, which took more time and limited the amount of correction possible. This newer system simplifies the process by moving just the lens (instead of the entire optical block) for faster and more accurate error correction.For immersive, dynamic surround sound, you can route both Dolby Digital and DTS 5.1-channel surround-sound signals through the player's digital-audio outputs (one each of RCA coaxial and Toslink optical) for a direct connection with a compatible AV receiver and surround speaker system (but be aware that digital-audio interconnects are not supplied).As soon as you hook up the DVD player, a special Quick Setup screen appears ready to guide you through configuration, step by step, screen by screen. DVD resume memory kicks in whenever you stop a DVD. Later, when you come back to it, the player will pick up right where you left off before. The player holds resume points for up to six discs.Other playback features include 10-second instant replay, DVD/CD Text display (with applicable discs), a digital video enhancer, digital video EQ (equalization), custom parental control memory for 40 discs, as well as Advanced SmoothScan and SmoothSlow Modes.What's in the BoxDVD player, remote control, 2 AA batteries, a stereo analog audio/composite-video interconnect, a user's manual, and warranty information.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31MSFP5RXWL._SX300_.jpg,145.95,,Electronics,Home Audio,Stereo Components,CD Players & Recorders,CD Players,

Apple iPod 30 GB White M8948LL/A (3rd Generation)  (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"The super-slim iPod once again redefines what a digital music player should be. It&#x92;s lighter than 2 CDs, can hold up to 7500 songs, and downloads music at blazing speeds. Now you can take your entire music collection with you wherever you go.Smaller than ever (just 0.62 inches thick), this iPod fits comfortably in the palm of your hand and slips easily into your pocket and your life. At 5.6 ounces, it weighs less than 2 compact discs, and even many cell phones.Once again, Apple turns the portable digital music player market on its ear with hassle-free functionality and stunning, well-considered design that place iPod far ahead of the curve and the competition. Building on the success of the touch wheel (which made scrolling through an entire music collection quick and easy), the new iPod has been re-engineered with a all-touch interface for enhanced durability and sensitivity. With an LCD screen and buttons that feature a backlight for clear visibility in low-light conditions, iPod is designed for easy one-handed operation. So the best way to take an entire music collection anywhere is now even better.The 30GB iPod model comes with a dock that makes charging and syncing easier than ever--no more reaching around, looking for the right port. An elegant, convenient home base for iPod on a desk or connected to a home stereo system, the dock provides syncing via FireWire or USB 2.0 (Syncing with USB 2.0 (Windows-only) requires optional USB 2.0 + FireWire Cable and free software update, available in June), charging via FireWire and audio line out for connecting to powered speakers or a stereo system.Designed to give you the best portable digital music experience ever, the iPod delivers the highest sound quality from input to output. iPod supports the most popular audio formats, including MP3 (up to 320 kbps), MP3 Variable Bit Rate (VBR) and WAV, giving you access to a wide range of audio file types. And iPod is the only portable digital music player that supports the AAC format (Mac-only), which features CD-quality audio in smaller file sizes than MP3, so that even more songs fit on your iPod.The iPod now lets you do a whole lot more in addition to maintaining your contacts, calendar and to-do lists. iPod now includes Solitaire, Brick and Parachute, three great games you can play anywhere (a feature you&#x92;re sure to appreciate the next time you&#x92;re standing in line or waiting for someone). You can even use your own music as the soundtrack to a game.iPod also includes a notes reader that lets you download text-based information and read it on the screen. This way you can have the information you need, on everything from restaurant reviews to nightlife guides, and from news articles to exercise routines, at your fingertips.The iPod features a sleep timer, so you can fall asleep to your music. And with the iPod&#x92;s new alarm clock, you can choose either an alarm tone or your favorite music to wake you up.The new iPod was designed for listening to digital music away from your computer, whether it&#x92;s a Mac or Windows PC. One simple connection does it all. A handy new dock connector on the bottom of the iPod enables the device to link to a computer and sync files via FireWire 400 (Mac or Windows) or USB 2.0 (Windows only). The result? Blazingly fast transfer speeds that let you load an album in as little as 10 seconds.For Mac users, iPod ships with iTunes 4. iTunes 4 supports ripping music into the new AAC format which combines pristine CD-quality sound with smaller files sizes, compared to MP3s. And iTunes 4 lets you share and stream playlists from your personal music library to up to three other Macintosh computers for personal use. Mac requirements are: Apple computer with built-in FireWire port; Mac OS X v10.1.5 or later (Mac OS X 10.2 or later recommended); CD includes iTunes(7) for Mac OS X.For Windows users, iPod includes the award-winning PC media player MUSICMATCH Jukebox Plus.

Sony DVPNS725P Progressive-Scan DVD/CD Player,"High-end video performance can be yours with Sony's affordable, progressive-scan DVP-NS725P DVD player. The versatile unit plays just about any disc out there--including DVD-Video, DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD+R, and DVD+RW--and also plays hours of music from MP3 files burned to CD-R/CD-RW discs.Whether your living room is currently home to an HDTV or you're merely thinking of ""someday,"" the DVP-NS725P stands ready to deliver the full potential of your DVDs through Sony's Precision Cinema Progressive de-interlacer (scanning) with 3:2 pulldown processing. Progressive scanning, referred to as 480p for the number of horizontal lines that compose the video image, creates a picture using twice the scan lines of a conventional DVD picture, giving you higher resolution and sharper images while eliminating nearly all motion artifacts.DVD mastering introduces a common distortion when adjusting 24-frames-per-second movies to 30 fps video; 3:2 pulldown digitally corrects this distortion, removing the redundant information to display a film-frame-accurate picture. Composite- and S-video outputs bring compatibility with nearly any television.Both Dolby Digital and DTS 5.1-channel surround-sound signals can also be routed through the player's digital-audio outputs (one each of RCA coaxial and Toslink optical) for a simpler connection to a compatible AV receiver (digital-audio interconnects are not supplied).Precision Drive 2 provides a mechanism for reading DVDs that are in less-than-perfect condition, eliminating errors in playback due to imperfect, scratched, or warped discs. DVD resume memory kicks in whenever you stop a DVD. Later, when you come back to it, the player will pick up right where you left off before. The player holds resume points for up to 40 discs.Other playback options include 10-second instant replay, quick setup, DVD/CD Text, a digital video enhancer, digital video EQ (equalization), custom parental control memory for 40 discs, Advanced SmoothScan and SmoothSlow Modes, and multidisc resume (up to 6 discs).What's in the BoxDVD player, RMT-D153A remote control, two AA batteries, an analog audio/composite-video cable, and user's manual.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31300CZTRML._SX300_.jpg,33,,Electronics,Television & Video,DVD Players & Recorders,DVD Players,,

TDK DA-9000 Jukebox Audio CD Recorder with 20 GB Hard Drive (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"Beneath its sleek industrial design and elegant finish, TDK's DA-9000 CD-RW recorder/HDD jukebox recorder houses a 20 GB hard drive, combining the best features of a high-performance CD recorder with a computer-based digital music storage and playback device.The hard drive--upgradeable to 40 GB--gives you the ability to store all your MP3s for ready access and easy burning to music CD-R and CD-RW, and customizes your listening and your shared mixed discs with handy play lists. The 20 GB drive holds up to 30 audio CDs in their native 16-bit, 44.1 kHz PCM resolution, or over 4,000 MP3 files. Using its USB connection, you can transfer music into the DA-9000 from any PC, or rip songs directly to the hard drive from your existing audio CDs.Once a song file is saved in the DA-9000's hard drive, you can access all song information from the internal CDDB database, recording individual songs to CD disc any time you want. The DA-9000's built-in MP3 encoder lets you convert music tracks to MP3 files in 128 kbps, 320 kbps, or at full CD quality.The deck requires music CD-R and CD-RW discs for recording (computer data discs will not work), and includes a full complement of inputs and outputs to accommodate most music sources and connect to any home entertainment system. The recorder has no digital-audio input, however, so you won't be able to record files directly off minidiscs or perform direct CD-to-CD recording; files must come into the recorder through the stereo analog inputs, through USB, or from an audio or data CD.The DA-9000 also offers intuitively configured recording and playback controls, an adjustable record-level control for both digital and analog recording, and track indexing for analog music recording. It uses premium-quality digital converters for exceptional resolution and dynamic range, precision drive mechanisms for stable operation, and internal components specially selected for the best sound quality.The unit is fully compliant with the SCMS Serial Copy Management System, which limits digital copying to one generation.What's in the BoxCD recorder, a TDK PC transfer software CD-ROM a remote control, remote batteries, a USB cable, an RCA-Type stereo audio interconnect, and assorted product support materials (including a user's manual).",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/319HH4986JL._SY300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Home Audio,Stereo Components,CD Players & Recorders,CD Recorders,

"Apple eMac Desktop 17&quot; M8951LL/A (1.0-GHz PowerPC G4, 256 MB RAM, 80 GB Hard Drive, DVD-RW/CD-RW Drive)","series of desktop computers meshes well with situations where space is at a premium and the user is not necessarily a computing expert. It is therefore a particularly good fit in the elementary or high school classroom. In fact, Apple has designed the system with this purpose in mind. Heading the eMac roster is the eMac Desktop 17"" M8951LL/A, a sensibly designed yet capable unit that's ready for the unique conditions of a multi-user educational environment.Driven by a fast 1 GHz PowerPC G4 processor, 256 MB of SDRAM (expandable to one full GB), and an ATI Radeon 7500 graphics chipset with 32 MB of dedicated DDR SDRAM memory, the eMac Desktop 17"" M8951LL/A easily handles most any standard computer application.

Sharp Aquos LC-37HV4U 37-Inch HD-Ready Flat-Panel LCD TV,"Amazon.com Product Description Do it with quality, do it in style. Make the move to widescreen, flat-panel elegance with Sharp's 37-inch, HDTV- and PC-compatible LC-37HV4U Advanced Super View LCD television. Part of Sharp's stylish AQUOS line, the 1,366 x 768-resolution LC-37HV4U offers a 16:9 aspect ratio to match favorite movies and high-definition resolution up to 720p (progressive-scan).Sharp's flat-panels are a fraction of the width of traditional CRT TVs.At a mere three inches deep, the set is perfect for wall mounting, though it comes with a table stand for desktop positioning.

Nikon 70-200mm f/2.8G ED-IF AF-S VR Zoom Nikkor Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras,"Lens-making is an art--Nikon artisans craft Nikkor optics from the finest materials, taking pride in adding their intellect and technique to bring the world's finest lenses to life. They push the leading edge of lens-making in their effort to provide the ""glass"" that makes the world's greatest pictures.AF Nikkor lenses work with Nikon SLRs for optimal performance, even the very latest. The Nikon 70-200mm f2.8G IF-ED AF-S VR is a compact, lightweight G-type fast telephoto zoom with Vibration Reduction. VR operation offers the equivalent of using a shutter speed three stops (eight times) faster. In addition, active vibration mode selection is possible, for use in an active situation such as in a car, boat, or plane. VR On/Off mode available.The lens holds a fast and constant f2.8 maximum aperture through the entire focal range. The built-in Single Wave Motor provides ultra-fast, ultra-quiet AF operation. Five ED glass elements offer higher optical performance, and is protected by a dust and waterproof rubber sealing mount.Internal-focusing design smooths focusing and has great body balance, and the filter attachment does not rotate with focusing. It also features an M/A mode that enables instant switching from autofocus to manual with virtually no lag time even during AF servo operation, no power consumption during manual focus operation, rounded diaphragm (9 blades) for natural blur, and focuses as close as 4.9 feet in autofocus and 4.6 feet in manual focus. High-performance Nikon Super Integrated Coating offers superior color reproduction and minimizes ghost and flare. Detachable tripod mounting collar provided.The new G design enables apertures to be selected from select Nikon AF SLR camera bodies, incorporating distance information for flash and ambient light exposure processes. Fully compatible with Nikon TC-14E II, TC-17E II, and TC-20E II teleconverters and D1X, D2H, D1H, D100, D70, F6, F5, F100, N80, N75, and N65 cameras.ED glass: An essential element of Nikkor telephoto lensesNikon developed ED (Extra-low Dispersion) glass to enable the production of lenses that offer superior sharpness and color correction by minimizing chromatic aberration. Put simply, chromatic aberration is a type of image and color dispersion that occurs when light rays of varying wavelengths pass through optical glass. In the past, correcting this problem for telephoto lenses required special optical elements that offer anomalous dispersion characteristics--specifically calcium fluoride crystals. However, fluorite easily cracks and is sensitive to temperature changes that can adversely affect focusing by altering the lens' refractive index. So Nikon designers and engineers put their heads together and came up with ED glass, which offers all the benefits and none of the drawbacks of calcium fluorite-based glass. With this innovation, Nikon developed several types of ED glass suitable for various lenses. They deliver stunning sharpness and contrast even at their largest apertures. In this way, Nikkor's ED-series lenses exemplify Nikon's preeminence in lens innovation and performance.Nikon Super Integrated Coating ensures exceptional performanceTo enhance the performance of its optical lens elements, Nikon employs an exclusive multilayer lens coating that helps reduce ghost and flare to a negligible level. Nikon Super Integrated Coating achieves a number of objectives, including minimized reflection in the wider wavelength range and superior color balance and reproduction. Nikon Super Integrated Coating is especially effective for lenses with a large number of elements, like our Zoom-Nikkors. Also, Nikon's multilayer coating process is tailored to the design of each particular lens. The number of coatings applied to each lens element is carefully calculated to match the lens type and glass used, and also to assure the uniform color balance that characterizes Nikkor lenses. This results in lenses that meet much higher standards than the rest of the industry.Internal FocusingImagine being able to focus a lens without it changing in size. Nikon's IF technology enables just that. All internal optical movement is limited to the interior of the non-extending lens barrel. This allows for a more compact, lightweight construction as well as a closer focusing distance. In addition, a smaller and lighter focusing lens group is employed to ensure faster focusing. The IF system is featured in most Nikkor telephoto and selected Nikkor zoom lenses.Distance informationD-type and G-type Nikkors relay subject-to-camera distance information to AF Nikon camera bodies. This then makes possible advances like 3D Matrix Metering and 3D Multi-Sensor Balanced Fill-Flash. Note: D-type and G-type Nikkors provide distance information to the following cameras: Auto exposure; F6, F5, F100, F90X, F80, F75, F70, F65, F60, F55, F50, Pronea S, Pronea 600i, D2 series, D1 series, D100, and D70s/D70. Flash control; F6, F5, F100, F90X, F80, F75, F70, D2 series, D1 series, D100, and D70s/D70 cameras.G-type Nikkor lensThe G-type Nikkor has no aperture ring; aperture should be selected from camera body.Silent Wave MotorNikon's AF-S technology is yet another reason professional photographers like Nikkor telephoto lenses. AF-S Nikkors feature Nikon's SWM which converts ""traveling waves"" into rotational energy to focus the optics. This enables high-speed autofocusing that's extremely accurate and super quiet.M/A modeAF-S Nikkors feature Nikon's exclusive M/A mode, that allows switching from autofocus to manual operation with virtually no time lag--even during AF servo operation and regardless of AF mode in use.Vibration Reduction (VR)This innovative VR system minimizes image blur caused by camera shake, and offers the equivalent of shooting at a shutter speed three stops (eight times) faster. It allows handheld shooting at dusk, at night, and even in poorly lit interiors. The lens' VR system also detects automatically when the photographer pans--no special mode is required.VR operation works with the Nikon F6, F5, F100, F80, F75, F65, D2-series, D1-series, D100, D70-series, and D50 cameras.What's in the Box:Lens, 77mm snap-on front lens cap, rear lens cap LF-1, bayonet hood HB-29, soft pouch CL-M2.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41nn1v93WML._SX300_.jpg,,Nikon,Electronics,Camera & Photo,Lenses,Camera Lenses,Digital Camera Lenses,

Sony KV32HS510 32&quot; Flat-Screen HDTV,"Step into the world of high-definition television with Sony's KV-32HS510 HD-ready, flat-screen, Hi-Scan TV. Finished in stylish silver, this award-winning 32-inch WEGA set (it was a CNET Editor's Choice in November 2003) features an FD Trinitron picture tube, a DVI connection for an HDTV tuner, a 10-bit 3D digital comb filter, and a Memory Stick slot.The TV has a built-in 181-chanel NTSC tuner, and Sony's Digital Reality Creation MultiFunction feature upconverts the analog NTSC signals to near-HD quality, though you'll need a separate HDTV tuner to receive high-definition broadcasts. The KV-32HS510 set is compatible with the 480i, 480p, 720p, and 1080i formats.The KV-32HS510 includes a strong selection of Sony video enhancements. The HD Detailer Wideband Video Amplifier offers a high-bandwidth frequency rating that results in finer picture quality from HD sources. The 10-bit 3D comb filter renders superb gray-scale gradation for amazing picture detail. The 3:2 pulldown cinema video processing detects and converts film--which is shot at 24 frames per second (fps) compared with video's 30 fps rate--to video for a smooth, theaterlike experience at home.Other Sony enhancements include the Twin View function, which enables you to watch programs side by side from two different HD sources, and a scrolling channel index, which provides a preview window of other channels along the right side of the screen.You can view JPEG images captured from Sony digital cameras and camcorders using the built-in Memory Stick slot. Choose from an index of the images stored on the Memory Stick, or you can run a slideshow of those images.The KV32HS510 has a built-in 15-watt subwoofer and two 7.5-watt speakers that produce TruSurround SRS audio. Two component-video inputs (both at the rear) allow you to connect an optional HDTV receiver or a source with component-video outputs. It also has a DVI input (rear), analog audio output (rear), 4 A/V inputs (3 front, 1 rear), 3 S-video inputs (2 front, 1 rear), and 1 each of S-Link output and input (for connecting other Sony components).Tech TalkAspect ratio: The aspect ratio refers to the shape of the video image. Today's standard television has a 4:3 aspect ratio, which is almost square in appearance. Digital television will have either a 4:3 or 16:9 aspect ratio. A 16:9 aspect ratio is widescreen and appears rectangular--it looks more like a movie screen, filling more of the viewer's field of vision to yield a lifelike viewing experience.Scanning method: Frames of video are made up of many lines that are scanned onto a television screen so closely they appear to be a solid picture. The scanning method can be either interlaced or progressive. Interlaced scanning (also used in today's analog TV), indicated by an ""i"" in the video format, fills in the odd number lines (1,3,5,7...) and then fills in the even number lines (2,4,6,8...) until the frame is complete. Progressive scanning, ""p,"" fills in each line consecutively until the frame is complete, creating a seamless image.What's in the BoxSony KV-32HS510 32-inch TV, remote control (RM-Y190), 2 AA batteries, and printed operating instructions.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41EWR8SRD2L._SX300_.jpg,2.52,,Electronics,Television & Video,Televisions,LCD TVs,,

"Tivoli Audio Model Three AM/FM Clock Radio, Cherry/Metallic Taupe (Discontinued by Manufacturer)","For those who like to slumber in style, the Tivoli Model Three is the ultimate wake up call. With an understated cherry wood exterior, and large, easy-to-operate controls, the unit serves as a lesson in simplicity for other manufacturers who insist on making confusing, user-unfriendly clock radios. Although we had a few quibbles with some of the features, as well as the performance, of the Model Three, overall we recommend it is a wonderful bedside companion.DesignThe Model Three incorporates the audio and tuning technology of the TivoliModel Two, while adding a quartz mechanical movement clock and alarm circuitry. Like other Tivoli radios, the Model Three is just over 8 inches wide, 4.5 inches high, and 5.25 inches deep-- about the size of a toaster turned on its side. It fits well on a desk, dresser, or nightstand.The Model Three's single rotary dial handles tuning for both AM and FM stations. The dial is designed to move between stations at a speed that is a bit slower than the speed at which the user turns the knob-- a 5 to 1 ratio, to be exact. This ""ratio"" dialing technique makes it far easier to tune stations accurately and quickly. It's a nice touch that sets the unit apart from other desktop radios.The tuner band selection and volume dials are easy to control and they're well designed for hands of all sizes. A small LED power indicator, as well as an LED that helps determine signal strength, are positioned between the dials. We did have one gripe about the Model Three's controls, though. Unlike the high-contrast labeling we found on thePlatinum Series Model Oneradio, the Model Three's blue-grey lettering atop a taupe background is difficult to read, especially in low-light situations. We found ourselves struggling to see what station we were tuning and what functions we were selecting-- not something most desire on an alarm clock.Fortunately, the Model Two's clock is easy to read and simple to set. A rotating bezel on the clock's face adjusts the wake time while a single button on the back rotates the clock forward. These methods allowed us to set the clock and wake times with good accuracy. There's also a sleep timer that shuts the radio off after 20 minutes, allowing you to fall asleep to tunes. We were a little puzzled by Tivoli's decision to power the clock by what we initially thought was simply a AA backup battery (the battery is housed in the rear of the unit). In fact, a battery must be used at all times to power the clock as it does not pull juice from the wall outlet. This means that the battery will need to be checked regularly to ensure accurate timekeeping. When the unit is powered by AC, users can wake to the radio. When the unit is unplugged, however, or if the power goes out, the Model Two will deliver a battery-powered beeping alarm.A single, 3"" driver is positioned on top of the unit and is protected by a handsome metal speaker cover. A five-minute snooze button resides next to the speaker for those times when you just can't roll out of bed right away.The Model Three shares the same back panel ports as the Model Two's, meaning it can serve as the base unit for a more robust Tivoli stereo system. A coaxial antenna jack for the included FM antenna wire is provided, although the Model Three also has an internal FM antenna. Tivoli recommends using the supplied external one for tricky tuning in locales with a lot of closely-spaced stations. There's a handy switch for switching between the internal and external antennae, as well. A standard 3.5mm headphone jack is also provided, as is a 3.5mm auxiliary line in port for plugging in the Tivoli component CD player, theModel CD. For the really techno-savvy, there's also a 3.5mm mixing input that permits audio from your computer to be mixed in with the radio.Like the Model Two, the Model Three supports the addition of the TivoliCompanion Speakerfor full stereo separation, as well as theModel Subwooferfor extended bass range. There's a small balance dial on the rear of the unit if you choose to add the companion speaker, as well as a mono/stereo switch. If you want to use the Model Three as a component tuner-- not a bad idea given the overall quality and accuracy of the tuning circuitry-- Tivoli has provided a 3.5mm output port.Listening PleasureAs with the TivoliiPalportable speaker system, we were initially skeptical about the performance of a small, one-speaker unit that only offers monaural sound. The reality is that most small two-speaker systems don't allow you to place the speakers very far apart anyway, and the Model Three's rich, resonant sound more than made up for its lack of true stereo separation. Plus, the Model Three is a single, elegant box with no annoying speaker cords. While the Model Three does sound better than the iPal, we did notice that the Model Three, quite mysteriously, does not sound quite as good as the venerable Model One. There is faint but noticeable hiss that is not present in the Model One, and we wondered if the Model One's designer, the late Henry Kloss, had less of a part to play in the Model Three's design.Overall, though, we found the Model Three's sound impressive, especially coming from such a small unit. In most cases, it delivered rich, resonant sound. The Model Three's tuning felt less accurate than the Model One's but we were still able to dial in stations quickly and easily.As for its function as an alarm clock, the Model Three was spot on. Not a single tester who relied on the unit was late to work!ProsSimple, stylish constructionGood sound and tuning accuracyNice expansion optionsConsClock cannot be powered by AC (battery only)Slight hiss when compared side by side with the Model OneTuner is slightly less accurate than the Model One's",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41i7KaoBarL._SX300_.jpg,149,,Electronics,Home Audio,Radios,Clock Radios,,

Toshiba has augmented this capable yet cost-effective processor with 256 of PC2100 DDR memory and an integrated Intel 855GM graphics controller with shared (not dedicated) video memory. Not the best setup for demanding business or graphic applications or 3-D games, the unit is nevertheless powerful enough for most day-to-day remote and mobile computing tasks.Featuring a 30 GB hard disk, the Satellite M20-S257 offers adequate permanent storage space for most users but not enough for avid collectors of video footage or MP3s. The system's removable DVD-ROM/CD-RW drive allows you to archive data, burn and play audio CDs and watch the latest movies, but does not permit DVD writing.At 12.4 by 10.8 by 1.5 inches and 6 pounds, the Satellite M20-S257 is comfortably petite.

Midland 74-250C SAME Handheld Weather Alert Radio (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"Stay informed of current local weather and hazard conditions whether you're camping, hiking, hunting, or just hanging around the house with this handheld Midland weather alert radio. Capable of receiving seven National Oceanic & Atmospheric Association (NOAA) channels--each of which receives emergency advisories on tornadoes, floods, severe thunderstorms, civil danger warnings, and more--the 74-250C is a must for people who live in high-risk weather areas, or for people who just want a little extra protection when hitting the outdoors. Plus, the seven NOAA channels offer coverage for roughly 93 percent of the U.S., so most residents are well covered regardless of where they live.Another valuable function is the radio's Specific Area Message Encoding (SAME) reception. SAME allows users to program the radio to sound an alert only when weather and other emergencies threaten a specific county or counties. The technology eliminates all alerts from other areas, so users won't perk up their ears each time the alert sounds only to learn that the emergency is actually 100 miles up the highway. The 74-250C's memory system accepts up to nine counties, so you can monitor a broad swatch of counties at once or restrict it to one.Should an alert occur, users have a choice of three warning systems: a 90 dB siren, a voice alert, or a flashing red LED light. The siren is the best option for people who might not have their radios nearby at all times, while the latter two alerts are a bit less extreme on the ears. The digital panel, meanwhile, displays up to 56 messages, so you'll instantly know what's coming your way. Additional features include a built-in thermometer with a freeze alert that notifies you when the temperature drops below freezing, a full-function clock with an alarm and snooze button, an external earphone jack, and a water-resistant housing.The radio, which works with two AA batteries (not included), measures 2.38 by 4 by 1.25 inches (W x H x D) and is backed by a one-year warranty.What's in the Box74-250C radio, user's manual.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/415JBRWTJFL._SY300_.jpg,36.95,,Electronics,Portable Audio & Video,Radios,Weather Radios,,

"IBM ThinkPad R40 (27232FU) Laptop (1.30-GHz Pentium-M (Centrino), 256 MB RAM, 20 GB Hard Drive, DVD-ROM Drive)","Part of IBM's entry-level ""R"" series of ThinkPad mobile computers, the ThinkPad R40 (27232FU) Notebook delivers mid-level performance and wireless connectivity for a price that won't break the bank. Incredibly compact when compared to the majority of notebooks and backed by IBM's comforting three-year no-hassle warranty and 24/7 support, the ThinkPad R40 (27232FU) Notebook is an ideal solution for those who prioritize portability and post-purchase security.Driven by a 1.3 GHz Intel Pentium M processor, 256 MB PC2100 DDR SDRAM memory and a 16 MB ATI Mobility RADEON 7500 graphics chipset, the ThinkPad R40 (27232FU) is powerful enough for many standard mobile tasks but most definitely doesn't pack enough juice for true power users. Certainly it won't deliver a smooth frame rate to ultra-complex 3-D games and 3-D animation applications.Tipping the scales at 6.7 pounds and measuring a mere 10 by 6.3 by 1.5 inches, the ThinkPad R40 (27232FU) is exceptionally easy to transport and operate. IBM has equipped the unit with a comparatively small 20 GB hard disk for your everyday file and program access, a DVD-ROM drive for loading your latest apps, playing audio discs and watching the latest movies, and a midsize 14.1-inch TFT display screen capable of 1024 by 768 resolution. In this stock configuration, the system does not support or CD or DVD burning.Surprisingly, the cost-conscious ThinkPad R40 (27232FU) is home to many unique and practical perks, including a nifty keyboard-illuminating ThinkLight for low-light situations, a one-touch ""Access ThinkPad"" online support button, an S-Video out port, two high-speed USB 2.0 ports for fast interaction with external peripherals, and a full-size keyboard featuring IBM's user-friendly ThinkPad UltraNav multi-pointing system. Connectivity options include a low-speed 56K fax/modem, an RJ-45 Ethernet connector for high-speed Internet, email and network access, and an Intel PRO/Wireless Network Connection 802.11b.

Four equalization presets, folder navigation, 32-track programmable sequencing, repeat play, and shuffle play modes broaden your listening options.When the player starts, it fills a memory buffer with track data.

During this time, if the RioVolt is jarred so that the buffer can't be filled--as when jogging, for instance--then the player may begin to skip.

Hook the set up with any DTV set-top box or progressive-scan DVD player to take full advantage of its high resolution and picture-enhancing technologies.The 800-line DynaFlat screen brings higher resolution than that achieved by earlier-generation sets because the individual phosphor color spots (or pixels) are smaller and closer together in this configuration. The set's multiple-focus electron gun illuminates finer spots for a more detailed picture, edge-to-edge, and it's assisted in this job by a three-line digital comb filter and velocity-scan modulation circuitry.Velocity-scan modulation improves the definition at picture edges, creating sharper images by slowing the CRT (cathode-ray tube) beam's horizontal scanning during demanding work--say, when rendering transitions from light to dark parts of an image--and speeding it up when scanning easily rendered sections, like broad dark areas.Another set of image improvements is wrapped into Samsung's Pro Picture three-stage video correction: Total DSP (Digital Signal Processing), Pro Chip Plus (converts all interlaced analog signals to superior, flicker-free progressive scan images), and the above-mentioned three-line digital comb filter (which analyzes multiple lines of picture information to better minimize edge image artifacts while improving transition detail).A shadow mask is a thin sheet of perforated metal behind the screen that restricts electron flow, each hole in the sheet corresponding to a single pixel. An Invar mask uses an alloy that's especially resistant to the high temperatures generated by the electron beam, allowing in a brighter, clearer picture.The TXN2775HF performs 3:2 pulldown detection, a handy feature for watching progressive-scan movie programs in their native 24-frame format. Digital video mastering introduces a common distortion when adjusting 24-frames-per-second movies to 30 fps video; 3:2 pulldown digitally corrects this distortion, removing the redundant information to display a film-frame-accurate picture.Connections include a component-video input, an S-video input, a trio of composite-video inputs (with accompanying stereo analog RCA audio inputs), an RF input (for VCR or cable box), and a set of audio/video outputs for feeding a DVR or VCR. Convenient side-panel audio/video inputs foster hookups with camcorders and gaming consoles while preserving the set's uncluttered silver front panel.A zoom screen-filling option lets you customize the view of letterboxed DVDs from the supplied remote control, while screen-capture picture freezing lets you view still images, even with broadcast television. Convenient side-panel buttons let you configure the set and access its menus without having to use the remote.The TXN2775HF also features what Samsung terms a ""neo side-sound design"" aimed at delivering full-bodied sound with a clean, uncomplicated look. And, with 15 watts per channel x 2, you can be sure of the system's clarity and its ability to play loudly. Several sound modes offer dynamic audio settings for whatever you're watching; choose from standard, music, movie, speech, or custom. Surround-sound mode simulates an exciting surround effect from any two speakers, and a side-panel headphone jack allows private listening (headphones not included).What's in the BoxTV, universal remote control, remote batteries, and user's manual.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513DK7GDM7L._SX300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Television & Video,Televisions,LCD TVs,,

"HP Pavilion a250n Desktop PC (2.60-GHz Pentium 4 (Hyper-Threading), 512 MB RAM, 120 GB Hard Drive, DVD+RW/CD-RW Drive, CD-ROM Drive)","While most models in HP's Pavilion a200n Desktop PC series of personal computers are best suited to those who don&#x92;t need or can&#x92;t afford a high-end personal computer, the top-of-the-line Pavilion a250n is packed with power and amenities. Gamers and anyone who works primarily with 3-D applications will want to upgrade the installed video card, but everyone else should find the Pavilion a250n more than enough computer for their needs.For the Pavilion a250n, HP has replaced the AMD Athlon processor found in the majority of the a200n series with a potent 2.6 GHz Intel Pentium 4 CPU with Hyper-Threading technology (Intel's new process whereby single CPU systems partially mimic dual-CPU systems -- thus boosting performance during high-drain procedures). The unit features a perfectly adequate amount of memory at 512 MB, but seems curiously underpowered graphically with the same 64 MB nVidia GeForce4 MX video card used in many of HP's lower-priced machines. In its stock configuration, the system will blast through most home, home office and professional 2-D tasks but will have trouble efficiently rendering some high-end 3-D animation apps and games.The Pavilion a250n is blessed with a bevy of data handling options, including a massive 120 GB hard disk, a 3.5-inch diskette drive for smaller programs and backups, a fast 48-speed CD drive or playing music discs and installing applications, and a convenient DVD-RW/CD-RW combo drive through which users may burn audio CDs, backup data, watch their favorite movies, and record homegrown videos to DVD. To exchange information with external devices such as DV camcorders and digital cameras, the system also features six fast USB 2.0 ports (two on the front), two FireWire interfaces (one front, one rear), and a 6-in-1 media card reader.Connectivity options include a 56K modem for low-speed surfing and a 10/100Base-T networking interface for high-speed e-communications. HP has added a two-button PS/2 scrolling mouse and convenient HP Multimedia keyboard but has not enclosed a display or speakers.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41N26DZV8SL._SX300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Computers & Accessories,Desktops,,,

Pioneer PD-M426 6-Disc Magazine CD Player (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"Easy to manage and outfitted with a nice array of features, the Pioneer PD-M426 CD changer stores up to six CDs at once in its removable magazine, keeping the music flowing for hours. A magazine CD changer is ideal for listeners who like to organize their music by theme or artist. All they need to do is remove one magazine and insert another whenever they want to enjoy a different genre or set of CDs (each additional magazine is sold separately). It's a great way to downshift from upbeat dance tunes to mellow trance music while hosting a party, or to listen to a favorite artist's entire catalogue while cleaning the house.The audio sounds smooth and precise thanks to the 1-bit digital-to-analog converter and the low-noise, low-loss laser pickup. Among the playback functions are 32-track programming, which lets the listener create a custom soundtrack (the programmed tracks even stay in the memory after the unit shuts off); random play (one or all discs); and five unique repeat modes. An added convenience derives from the Delete Program Playback function, which lets listeners delete tracks or discs that they don't want to play without removing the CDs from the magazine.Additional features include Hi-Lite Scan, which plays roughly 10 seconds from the first track on either one or all the discs; timer playback when connected to an external timer unit; a programmable pause function (useful when recording onto a cassette); a full-function remote control; and system remote in/out jacks. The remote jacks let users connect the CD changer to a compatible Pioneer receiver, and then control the changer using the receiver's remote.The PD-M426 measures 16.56 by 4.12 by 11.56 inches (W x H x D) and carries a one-year warranty on parts and labor.What's in the BoxPD-M426 CD changer, one magazine, remote control, user's manual.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31X936TKEWL._SX300_.jpg,145.95,,Electronics,Home Audio,Stereo Components,CD Players & Recorders,CD Players,

Onkyo TX-SR701 THX Select Digital A/V Receiver (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"For discerning audiophiles and anyone seeking high quality and home theater convenience, Onkyo's high-value TX-SR701 6.1-channel surround receiver features thunderous power, the latest surround-processing abilities, and a suite of high-end features like digital bass management for multichannel DVD-Audio and SACD music sources, sophisticated video conversion and switching capabilities, and multi-room flexibility, including Onkyo's Powered Zone 2.People new to home theater will find relief in the receiver's user-friendly design, which uses color-coded inputs and outputs, a logically laid-out front panel, and an easy-to-use, preprogrammed/learning remote control. Those looking to upgrade their current home theater receiver will be impressed with the receiver's six, high-current channels (100 watts per channel) and processing for all major surround formats, and then some, including Dolby Digital EX (6.1) and DTS-ES.Onkyo's Powered Zone 2 capability can be used to power stereo speakers in a second room as well as in the main zone, thanks to a dedicated set of zone 2 L/R speaker terminals. The receiver is capable of processing separate stereo sources simultaneously for each zone, or sending the same signal to both. There's also a set of zone-2 preamplifier outs that can be used in conjunction with an external power amplifier.The TX-SR701's 5.1-channel analog input includes sophisticated bass management capabilities, which can be critical for enjoying high-resolution DVD-Audio and SACD with a multichannel speaker system. Incoming signals are digitized and then processed by the receiver's DSP to route low-frequency information to a subwoofer while excluding deep bass from small satellite speakers that are not meant to handle deep bass. The subwoofer crossover is selectable at 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, or 150 Hz for optimal integration with any speaker arrangement. This feature can also be bypassed with Onkyo's exclusive Pure Audio Mode for the ultimate in analog signal fidelity when with full-range speakers.Further, Onkyo includes a number of exclusive audio-enhancing features and technologies, like discrete output stages, high-bandwidth WRAT (Wide Range Amplifier Technology) and a reduced-NFB (negative feedback) amplifier design.The TX-SR701 handles a range of audio and video sources, from front-panel audio/video/S-video jacks for simple hookups with camcorders, game consoles, and VCRs, to multiple rear-panel inputs. Rear connections include 2 high-resolution component-video inputs and a set of multichannel RCA analog inputs (perfect for use with a DVD-Audio or SACD player's high-resolution analog outputs). You also get 4 digital-audio ins (3 optical, 1 coaxial) and 2 digital-audio outs (1 each optical and coaxial) for connections with DVD players, a satellite receiver, a CD recorder, MD recorder, or other gear.What's in the BoxReceiver, remote control, remote batteries, AM/FM antennas, user's manual, and warranty/registration information.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JJP69AWJL._SX300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Home Audio,Stereo Components,Receivers & Amplifiers,Component Receivers,

Sony DSCP7 Cyber-shot 3.2MP Digital Camera w/ 3x Optical Zoom,"Sony's DSC-P7 combines compact dimensions with a high-performance 3.2-megapixel sensor and a 3x optical zoom lens. If you're looking for a take-anywhere camera that's easy to use and produces crisp, detailed images, the P7 is worth a closer look.Optics and ResolutionThe DSC-P7's 3.2-megapixel sensor captures ample detail for sharp prints at sizes up to 11 by 14 inches. For a serious amateur photographer, 3 megapixels is a great resolution, providing enough detail to perform some cropping and still have crisp prints.A 3x optical zoom lens (39-117mm equivalent) helps you to capture exactly the picture you want, and an additional 2x digital zoom (6x total) further magnifies your image. Remember, however, that digital zoom tends to reduce the sharpness and detail of your image, so it's best used sparingly. In low-light situations (a particular weakness for many digital cameras), a focus-assist lamp sends out a small patterned beam to help the camera accurately determine distance.To compose your images, either use the traditional camera viewfinder or the 1.5-inch LCD display (which is also used to review the shots you've taken). Having both types of viewfinders offers the best of both worlds: If you're used to using a film camera or want to conserve battery life, use the viewfinder; if you want to see exactly the picture you'll be capturing, use the LCD display.More FeaturesThe DSC-P7 is designed to be a simple point-and-shoot, so it doesn't have a huge assortment of manual settings. However, more advanced photographers will appreciate the manual focus mode, adjustable ISO, and white-balance settings, as well as the exposure compensation and the ability to shoot black-and-white, sepia, solarized, and negative images.Other features include a three-area multipoint autofocus and a multiburst function that captures 16 320 x 240 frames with three selectable intervals for convenient motion analysis.PowerThe DSC-P7 uses a proprietary rechargeable InfoLithium battery (modelNP-FC10), which can provide power for up to 90 minutes of continuous camera usage. To ensure you'll always be ready for action, we recommend purchasing a spare battery.Movie ModeIn movie mode, the camera captures silent video clips. Most digital cameras' movie modes are limited to 15- or 30-second clips, but the DSC-P7 can keep shooting until you've filled the memory card. It features three MPEG movie modes: video mail (160 x 112), presentation (320 x 240), and HQX (320 x 240) with 16 fps full-screen playback.The limited resolution of your movies guarantees that this feature won't replace your camcorder, but it's perfect for when you just want to capture a quick movie and e-mail it to a friend or relative.Storage and TransferImages are stored on Memory Sticks, Sony's proprietary memory-card format. The included 16 MB stick holds approximately 16 images at the camera's default settings. Memory Sticks are reusable, but if you tend to take more than 16 images per outing, then you'll want a bigger card. A 128 MB stick is a great size for this camera, storing around 130 images.To transfer images to your computer, simply attach the included USB cable between your PC and your camera--your computer should automatically recognize the camera and let you move the pictures to your hard drive. If you own a Sony desktop or laptop, your computer may also have a built-in Memory Stick reader, which makes transferring as easy as reading a floppy disk.SizeAt 4.5 by 2 by 1.44 inches and 7.5 ounces fully loaded, the DSC-P7 is a very compact and portable digital camera.Contents and Recommended AccessoriesThe package includes the DSC-P7 camera, one rechargeable NP-FC10 InfoLithium battery, AC-LS1 AC adapter/in-camera charger, video and USB cables, wrist strap, 16 MB Memory Stick, and software on CD.Everything you need to get started is included in the box, but we recommend these accessories to make the most of your camera: a carrying case, a spare NP-FC10 InfoLithium battery, and a higher-capacityMemory Stick.

D Link AirPlus DWL-900AP+ Wireless 22MBPS Access Point,"The D-Link AirPlus DWL-900AP+ can be configured to perform in any one of four modes--as a wireless access point, as a point-to-point bridge with another access point, as a point-to-multipoint wireless bridge, or as a wireless client. It also includes an embedded DHCP server that, once enabled, will automatically assign IP addresses to wireless clients. It also eliminates the need for a separate DHCP server on the network. This unique feature is ideal for quickly creating a wireless local area network in offices or other workplaces, or a temporary network at trade shows or other events.The DWL-900AP+ also features 256-bit WEP encryption for a higher level of security for your data and wireless communications.The DWL-900AP+ is fully compatible with the IEEE 802.11b standard, making it interoperable with all existing 802.11b-compliant devices. But unlike standard 802.11b access points, its data transfer rate can be up to 20 percent faster. When your wireless network is comprised of other D-Link AirPlus products, such as the DWL-520+ wireless PCI adapter, the DWL-650+ wireless CardBus adapter, and the DI-614+ wireless router--transfer rates can be as high as 22 Mbps.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41FBGVA3GTL._SX300_.jpg,21.79,,Electronics,Computers & Accessories,Networking Products,Wireless Access Points,,

If you plan on printing your photos at 11 by 14 inches or larger, you'll probably want a camera with higher resolution than the DSC-P2 offers--we recommend Sony's compact, 3.2-megapixelDSC-P7.A 3x optical zoom lens (39-117mm equivalent) helps you to capture exactly the picture you want, and an additional 2x digital zoom (6x total) further magnifies your image.
