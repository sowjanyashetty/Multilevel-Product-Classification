The headphones can receive the signal via radio waves within a range of up to 100 meters--even through floors, walls, and ceilings. A choice of three transmission frequencies ensures clear reception, and a filter blocks out interference from amateur radio transmissions.With the RS4-9 wireless headphones you can roam your house or work out to your favorite tunes without tangling cords or losing reception. The headphones are lightweight and adjustable, and a volume knob on the headset gives you complete control.The T4 transmitter features an automatic on/off function and operates on AC or DC current or on a single BA151 NiMH battery. The headphones will run for 3.5 hours on battery power, and the Accupack has two rechargeable-battery compartments.A two-year warranty is provided.\",\n          \"Equipped with a five-CD changer, Panasonic's SC-AK18 compact stereo lets you enjoy hours of continuous music. The five direct open/play keys make playing and changing discs easy. Simply press the open key for the desired disc and the tray opens. After changing the disc, press the adjacent disc key. The tray closes, and the newly loaded disc starts to play.Outfitted with dual feather-touch cassette decks and an AM/FM digitally synthesized tuner, the SC-AK18 has all the conveniences of a full-size stereo system. Two other features are the CD manager, which simplifies CD-to-tape editing, and tape program search for quick tape-track access.The 3D space equalizer displays a wide range of images and patterns. A ship flies in space, enters black holes--even time warps--as your selections play. And six preset equalization modes (disco, hall, live, heavy, clear, and soft) are a touch away.The AK-18 standard features include a wireless remote control, a programmable timer with sleep mode, 24 tuner presets, and a fluorescent display.\",\n          \"With built-in Dolby Digital, DTS, and Dolby Pro Logic decoding, Pioneer's VSX-D309 surround receiver lets you take full advantage of today's 5.1-channel movies and music. Dialogue and sound effects come through with great clarity and spaciousness for an excellent home theater experience.The VSXD309 provides an ample 60 watts of amplifier power to each of its five channels (left/right front, center, and left/right rear). It also offers a subwoofer output for incorporating the \\\".1\\\" low-frequency effects (LFE) channel encoded on most DVDs and on DTS-mastered surround sound compact discs.Complete 5.1-channel analog inputs bring welcome flexibility, letting you use the VSX-D309 with a surround-decoding DVD player or a future six-channel surround format.Ten digital signal processing (DSP) environments transport you to your venue of choice--including hall, jazz club, and stadium--for a customized sonic experience.The midnight mode compresses dynamic range while slightly increasing the clarity of dialogue for late-night viewing sessions. Midnight mode also dims the VSX-D309's front-panel display.The VSX-D309 has plenty of standard features as well. Three audio-video inputs accommodate a DVD player, a VCR, and another component, such as a second VCR. Nestled around back are a subwoofer output and two digital audio inputs, one coaxial and one optical. The Pioneer VSX-D309 comes with a remote control and a one-year warranty on parts and labor.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n

Tracing is expensive and the excessive number of tracings could be due to (1) creating @tf.function repeatedly in a loop, (2) passing tensors with different shapes, (3) passing Python objects instead of tensors. For (1), please define your @tf.function outside of the loop. For (2), @tf.function has reduce_retracing=True option that can avoid unnecessary retracing.
