Cisco-Linksys EFAH05W EtherFast 10/100 5-Port Workgroup Hub,"The EtherFast 5-Port 10/100 Auto-Sensing Hub from Linksys is the quickest way to build or expand a Fast Ethernet network. Each port automatically detects and negotiates 10 Mbps and 100 Mbps connections (dual speed per port). You can mix 10BaseT and 100BaseTX hardware on the same hub without using a switch or any additional network hardware. The EtherFast 5-Port 10/100 Auto-Sensing Hub is perfect for small workgroups interested in expanding as their networking needs grow. You can easily connect to other hubs and switches by using the shared uplink port. When all ports on the hub are running at 100 Mbps, the uplink port becomes capable of sending data up to 100 meters (328 feet) at a blazing 100Mbps.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JSBWRCYCL._SX300_.jpg,79.0,,Electronics,Computers & Accessories,Networking Products,Hubs,,
Nikon Coolpix 800 2MP Digital Camera w/ 2x Optical Zoom,"Nikon first brought 2-megapixel quality to the consumer price range with the Coolpix 950; the Nikon Coolpix 800 digital camera continues Nikon's professional legacy at an even more affordable price point. With a 2.11-million-pixel, 0.5-inch CCD and a maximum resolution of 1,600 x 1,200, the Coolpix 800 gives you topnotch picture quality and a wide array of advanced features. It lets you save images in an uncompressed TIFF format plus three JPEG compression modes, with two resolution choices. It sports a 2x Zoom-Nikkor lens and a 1.25 to 2.5x digital zoom; you can shoot subjects as close as 2.8 inches away with the Macro setting.The Nikon Coolpix 800's autofocus is truly impressive--it uses 480 steps for incredibly accuracy. The camera also offers 256-element matrix, spot, and center-weighted exposure modes. The built-in Speedlight flash includes auto flash, flash cancel, fill flash, slow sync, and red-eye reduction modes. Battery life is also a winner--even with the LCD turned on, the Nikon Coolpix 800 offers a battery life of approximately 100 minutes using four AA alkaline batteries. It ships with an industry standard 8 MB Nikon CompactFlash memory card, which stores up to 200 images, depending on image size; you can buy optional CompactFlash cards with up to 64 MB of memory.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/7183RBY625L._SX300_.gif,7.33,,Electronics,Camera & Photo,Digital Cameras,Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,,
Aiwa XR-M75 Compact Stereo System (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"With so many compact and mini stereos to choose from, you might find the buying process more than a little confusing. We're happy to recommend the Aiwa XR-M75 as a good starter for a small-scale system. A four-box rig, the XR-M75 comprises a tuner/amplifier, a top-loading single-CD player, and pair of two-way speakers.The unit is finished in gunmetal gray and has stylish, rounded front edges. You can stack these hefty, durable units on top of one another or place them side by side, depending on your needs. The speakers' high-gloss faux burled-walnut finish imparts a semiluxurious look.Overall setup is a breeze, as is committing radio stations to memory and setting the timer. One functional feature we especially like is the control-panel drawer that slides from the bottom of the tuner/amplifier. The drawer contains the unit's main controls (you can also access these controls from the remote), leaving the faceplate delightfully free of clutter.The XR-M75 sounds best reproducing vocals and small-ensemble or acoustic music at moderate levels. Its overall sound is well balanced but a little on the light side--it doesn't produce a lot of bass, especially by today's standards. When you push the XR-M75 to loud levels on rock music, it audibly distorts, so be sure this mini stereo's abilities match your listening tastes.We've looked at a lot of mini systems, and with its clean design, thoughtful array of features, and ease of setup and operation, the Aiwa XR-M75 is one of the most appealing of the bunch.Pros:Easy to set up and useAuxiliary inputs accept VCR or PC sourcesCan record to auxiliary cassette, minidisc, or CD recorderCons:Doesn't play well at really loud levelsRemote is a tabletop unit, awkward to use with one hand",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41S6N954G1L._SX300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Home Audio,Compact Stereos,,,

Yamaha EQ-70 Stereo Equalizer (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"With a per-band range of +/-12dB for both left and right channels, the EQ-70 gives you complete equalization (EQ) control over the entire audio spectrum, allowing you to tailor your sound with precise boosts and cuts at specific frequencies to bring out more bass, enhance the vocals, roll off the highs, or customize your own response curves to get just the sound you want. An independent output-level control allows for proper matching between the EQ on and EQ defeat modes, eliminating the need for main amplifier adjustments. This allows you to monitor recordings with the EQ engaged, and to shape the music you're recording to best match the acoustic characteristics of the place you'll be listening to your recording. Listening comparisons between equalized and unequalized response can be made with the front panel EQ on/defeat switch. This control is also useful if your equalizer is set for a response curve for particular types of music. When you change to other musical sources, the EQ can be defeated at the touch of a button. To better match output levels when the equalizer is engaged or defeated, the EQ-70 has an LED-lit level control. This slider is precisely calibrated (with +/-6 dB click stops), to give you maximum control and maximum efficiency in audio output.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/314N1FGYAKL._SX300_.jpg,133.71,,Electronics,Home Audio,Stereo Components,Equalizers,,

Tuning is accomplished by clicking a switch to the appropriate band, then dialing up or down, refining the tuning by hand as you go. The all-inclusive frequency display results in imprecise indications, so it is not possible to determine exactly which frequency you are tuning in. But our reception in all bands on any strong signal was excellent.Overall, we found this a sensitive radio with great portability that would make great introductory piece for anyone interested in shortwave radio listening. The Sangean SG-622 is powered by 3 AA batteries, but consider adding an AC adapter to reduce your battery expense.It comes with a one-year warranty on parts and labor.Pros:Excellent receptionGreat portabilityExtremely easy to use, great for the noviceCons:Does not include adapterAntenna does not have 360-degree rotation for improving receptionAmbiguous frequency display",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/81FW7RR12VL._SX300_.gif,34.56,Sangean,Electronics,Portable Audio & Video,Radios,Shortwave Radios,,

Epson PhotoPC 800 2.14MP Digital Camera,"The PhotoPC 800, Epson's newest addition to its digicam fleet. is nicely armored in brushed aluminum with charcoal trim, and is small enough to be a true ""pocket battleship."" Its 2.1-megapixel firepower can take aim at any target you want to blow up to 8 by 10 inches or larger.But like any ship of the line, it has some vulnerabilities that may prove troublesome. Unlike most digicams, the PhotoPC uses 3.3 volts rather than 6 to power the camera's LCD monitor, internal electronics, and flash. Two AA's just can't cut it, even if they're rechargeable NiMHs (Four batteries plus a charger come standard). As a result, you cannot use the LCD monitor for more than 10 seconds at a time if you want to get more than a couple dozen pictures (with flash) out of a set of batteries. It's possible to set the LCD to stay on for up to 3 minutes (and you may need to if you're using accessory lenses with the optional lens adapter), but your batteries will die quickly, especially if you're also viewing pictures in the playback mode. So get ready to shoot most of your pictures through the PhotoPC 800's optical viewfinder.Epson has given the PhotoPC 800 multiple personalities that can interact with beginning, intermediate, and advanced photographers. However, the unorthodox menu system is difficult to master. There are seven different buttons on the camera, each of which can perform multiple functions, depending upon the choices that appear on the adjacent screen. Even the well-written 224-page manual demands quite a bit of attention before things start to fall into place.The beginner's setting turns the camera into an entirely automatic (including focus), typical point-and-shoot. You can set various program modes in the intermediate level depending on the kinds of shots you want: action, landscape, or portrait, Advanced mode allows adjustment of lens openings (either f-2.4 or f-8), shutter speeds and distance presets. Beware, though--setting shutter speeds manually (1/2 to 1/750 seconds) doesn't set the appropriate lens openings, so you should use that feature to deliberately overexpose or underexpose in unusual lighting conditions or for special effects.The PhotoPC 800's top-mounted dial lets you select seven modes: set-up, printer-direct, playback, off, optical viewfinder only, optical viewfinder and LCD monitor, and continuous (and interval) shooting. The camera's three-button top deck LCD handles critical functions such as resolution, flash, and the self-timer. It'll also give you an instant read-out on the ISO (sensitivity to light), white balance setting, number of pictures left, and battery condition. Holding the camera is a bit awkward because you have to pinch the top and bottom of it with the thumb and forefinger of your left hand to avoid obstructing the lens (an accessory pistol grip would help a lot here). And like most small digicams, it comes with only a wimpy wrist strap.Despite obvious shortcomings, the PhotoPC 800 has many impressive features that make it a real contender. It can shoot at 1,600-by-1,200-pixel resolution with two compression choices, and it can render the obligatory 640 by 480 for the Web. There's even an interpolated mode called HyPict that ups the resolution to 1,984 by 1,488 pixels inside the camera before the picture is compressed, so that all the captured raw data is used. Of course, you lose a little sharpness, but you can easily correct the image before you print it with an image editing program.Other good attributes are fast-interval shooting (about a picture per second) at 1,600-by-1,200-pixel resolution, a burst mode that can work in conjunction with the self-timer (so you can analyze your golf swing), and a time-lapse function you can use to shoot pictures at intervals from 10 seconds to 24 hours. You can also set exposure for each shot, operate the camera from your Mac, and use USB to transfer the images. If you make presentations, this may be your dream digicam. You can ad voice comments in 3-, 5-, and 10-second sound bites either as you shoot or afterward, exclude pictures you don't want to show, and rotate pesky verticals. You can also upload existing computer presentations for display on a TV or with an AV projector, or for easy transfer to video-tape. Finally, the PhotoPC 800 prints directly to the Epson StylusPhoto, , 700, 750, 1200, and Stylus Color 740 printers without using the Mac.Both the PhotoPC 800's 2X digital zoom and its panorama settings cut the camera's effective resolution in half, and the macro settings can only get in to about 6 inches. However, the proof of the pudding is in the output, and after getting comfortable with the camera and printing some large, luscious, almost artifact-free photographs, we found that the PhotoPC 800's somewhat complex mix of elements does indeed produce exquisite pictures. So if you're at ease with button-pushing and have deep pockets for extra batteries, this may be just the camera for you. --Arthur BleichGood News:Images to 11 by 14 inches. Fast interval shooting.

Panasonic SLSX270 Portable CD Player,"Jogging, driving, or hiking doesn't preclude enjoying the music you love. The Panasonic SLSX270 is a durable, portable CD player with features to accommodate movement and seemingly adverse conditions.It sports a heat-resistant, polycarbonate casing, so you can confidently place it on the dash of your car without damaging the CD player. It also has a sliding lock to keep the lid closed during rougher handling. A one-push, full-open mechanism pops the lid and slightly ejects the disc, so you can easily load and remove your audio media. Its compact design lets you slip it into a pocket or, using the included neoprene belt, take it with you wherever you go.Panasonic offers a one-bit digital-to-analog converter to ensure exceptional signal linearity--you can hear every quiet note amid competing instruments. The super-extra bass system delivers hard-hitting low-end, while a digital servo system maintains accurate reading and playback.People who exercise can put in a disc, program their settings, and forget worries about changing those settings--a convenient hold switch prevents other buttons from being pressed accidentally, saving batteries as well as effort.A top-mounted liquid crystal display reveals operating details such as track information and whether antishock is on or off. The Panasonic SL-SX270 offers 24-track random-access programming that lets you listen to songs on a CD in the order you prefer or completely at random.Track and disc repeat automatically replays any song or, once the disc is over, it starts at the beginning without stopping. You can skip through the tracks, search, or pause the music, and a resume function plays the music from the exact same spot.To eliminate audio skips, Panasonic offers in this model version 3.0 of its enhanced antishock memory. It gives you virtually flawless playback, even during jolt-heavy activities like driving and jogging.How does it work? Panasonic's antishock system rotates discs faster than normal speed, reading the digital data into a memory buffer. When a vertical shock occurs along the axis of a disc and causes a tracking error, the system plays music, stored 40 seconds in advance, from its digital memory so the correct tracking resumes.Additionally, the antishock memory has a sophisticated new chip to correct horizontal shocks that occur in the plane of disc rotation and can sometimes force the disc to momentarily spin faster or slower. Controlling sporadic disc speeds allows the digital memory buffer to cope with vertical errors and function at full capacity, though you should be aware that jolts continuing longer than the buffer can still interfere with playback.The SL-SX270 spins discs reliably and it plays them longer. On a pair of AA alkaline batteries (not included), it offers up to 28 hours of playback. It runs on an AC adapter that comes with the CD player, so you can listen to your favorite CDs right away. An auto power shutoff feature turns the unit off after five minutes of non-use to preserve battery life.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41QVYVGKD4L._SX300_.jpg,24.79,,Electronics,Portable Audio & Video,Portable CD Players,,,

RCA RS2625 Bookshelf System with SmarTrax (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"Ideal for listeners on a limited budget but who want a system that does more than just play CDs, the RCA RS2625 packs 150 watts of power into a compact package that fits easily on most bookshelves or tabletops. The stereo is equipped with a five-disc CD changer, a dual cassette deck, a digital AM/FM tuner, and a pair of two-way speakers, giving users everything they need to enjoy topnotch audio performance when listening to their favorite tunes. More significantly, the device is also compatible with MP3 files recorded on a CD-R disc, giving you access to far more of your digital music catalog. To support the MP3 functionality, RCA included its SmartTrax navigation technology, which helps you quickly access specific MP3 songs or playlists using a library of computer-generated ID tags that identify digital audio files by title, artist, album, year, genre and track number. The SmartTrax file management system can even ""read"" song data from your recordable CDs, letting you view track names and create playlists at the touch of a button.The five-disc changer, meanwhile, boasts such features as 32-track programming, CD-R and CD-RW compatibility, intro scan, random play, and repeat play (for one track, one disc, and all discs). Thanks to the carousel changer and the track programming, it's easier than ever to create a diverse custom soundtrack for parties or dinner gatherings. Listeners will also groove to the dual cassette deck, which records from both CDs and the radio. Topping off the component features is the drift-free, digital AM/FM tuner that accurately captures the signal every time. The radio even comes with 32 station presets that make it easy to immediately locate your favorite programs.To ensure a crisp, rich sound, RCA included titanium-plated cones in each speaker, along with five preset equalizer settings (pop, flat, jazz, rock, and classic), an X-Surround function that simulates surround sound effects, and a bass boost system to enhance the low-end frequencies. Additional features include a digital clock with an alarm and sleep timer, a display dimmer (ideal for bedrooms), and an infrared remote control. The main unit measures 12 by 12.2 by 15.4 inches (W x H x D) while each speaker measures 9.4 by 12.2 by 7.8 inches. The system is also backed by a one-year warranty on parts and labor.What's in the BoxMain unit, two speakers, remote control, user's manual.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41P73SKGAJL._SX300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Home Audio,Compact Stereos,,,

Magellan GPS 315 Waterproof Hiking GPS,"Magellan's GPS 315 doesn't have a lot of advanced features, but it does provide positional and directional readings accurate enough to help you find your way back to base camp when you're out in the woods. This portable global positioning system is one of the most compact we've ever tested, and it features a crisp display for the pages of information it throws at users.The GPS 315 is designed more for outdoor use than car navigation and doesn't display road maps. It does have a database of over 15,000 cities and the capability to accept up to 500 user-defined waypoints, so it still works fairly well for giving you bearings to the next town or point of interest. We used the tracking features extensively, which let us leave a ""bread crumb"" trail as we traveled. This was especially helpful when we were backtracking along the same route, as we were able to easily compare our current position with the trail on the display.The display has two levels of backlighting, a feature that drains the unit's two AA batteries at a frightening rate. However, without the backlight on, we got more than 12 hours of use from the unit.The GPS 315 uses simple controls that let users page through its numerous data screens. As long as we were moving the compass, the screens worked well; we especially liked the graphical compass that pointed out our current direction of travel and the bearing to a waypoint at the same time. The device can also serve as a full-fledged trip computer, measuring distance, average speed, and providing an estimated time of arrival. Perhaps the best thing about the GPS 315 is that all the data screens are fully customizable, letting users create their own data pages containing only the data they want to see.Although Magellan doesn't include a lot of goodies in the box, the GPS 315 has many optional accessories that increase its capabilities. For example, you can get a PC cable to upload topographical and street map data. Without all the extras the GPS 315 is better suited for hikers and boaters than highway travelers, but it's an accurate and inexpensive way to keep your bearings.--T.

"Sony VAIO PCG-TR1AP Laptop (900-MHz Pentium-M (Centrino), 512 MB RAM, 30 GB Hard Drive, DVD/CD-RW Drive)","Built for notebook users whose situations and requirements dictate extreme portability, Sony's TR series of mobile computers are amazingly petite yet satisfactorily powered. Demanding folks who need top-end speed and all the capabilities of a desktop should look elsewhere, but those who consistently work in remote environments or simply appreciate the convenience of extreme miniaturization would do well with this, the Sony VAIO PCG-TR1AP Notebook PC.At the heart of the VAIO PCG-TR1AP resides a 900 MHz ultra-low voltage Pentium M processor with an amazing one MB Level 2 cache. Sony has matched this processor with 512 MB DDR SDRAM memory and an integrated Intel 855GM graphics chipset with 64 MB of shared (not dedicated) video memory. Though this setup won't effectively drive the latest 3-D-based games or keep up with the current crop of desktops, the unit features advanced Intel Centrino mobile technology for improved performance and reduced power consumption over similar speed non-Centrino units, and as such will easily handle lengthy sessions with typical mobile applications.The VAIO PCG-TR1AP features an adequate 30 GB hard disk for your files and applications and a versatile CD-RW/DVD-RW combo drive through which you can archive data, burn and play audio CDs and enjoy the latest movies. You'll monitor your work through a crystal clear 10.6-inch wide (1280x768) TFT display with XBRITE technology, and enter data via an integrated 83-key keyboard and electro-static touchpad.At a mere 10.6 by 7.4 by 1.4 inches and just 3.1 pounds., the VAIO PCG-TR1AP is extraordinarily compact. Yet it's packed with useful amenities, including two high-speed USB 2.0 ports, one FireWire port, a high-speed RJ-45 Ethernet connection, and wireless LAN. Shutterbugs will appreciate the built-in low-resolution 640x480 swivel camera, while businesspeople will welcome the bundled version of Microsoft's high-end Windows XP Professional operating system.Battery life is estimated at an impressive 2.5 to 7 hours with the enclosed standard cell and 3.5 to 11 hours with a separately available large capacity battery.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Z8VWNNF1L._SX300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Computers & Accessories,Laptops,,,

NHT SuperZero Bookshelf Speaker (Single) (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"NHT (Now Hear This) has been making waves in high-end audio for some  time, offering solidly designed speakers at prices far lower than their stunning  sounds would lead you to expect. The SuperZero is a marvelous bookshelf design,  delivering sweet and seamless sound across most of the audio spectrum. In our  tests we found that the speaker rolls off bass in the bottom couple octaves,  making it most suitable as a satellite speaker in a home theater (and it's sold  singly, so you can buy five if you decide to go the home theater route).The speaker is quite plain to look at, but this only makes it all the more  stunning when you fire it up and hear its gloriously natural midrange and mellow  but perfectly detailed high frequencies. And we have no trouble recommending  this as a bookshelf speaker for close quarters--say, a bedroom or dorm room,  where placement near a wall will emphasize whatever bass is there. Additionally,  asubwooferwill do a great  deal to fill in the low end.Timbrally, apart from the drop-off in the low end, this speaker is spot on.  Voices, acoustic instruments, electric guitars, drums, synthesizers--you name  it, this speaker does it justice, letting you lose yourself in a musical  presentation for hours on end without strain or fatigue (provided you're not  playing them too loudly, of course. This is a definite temptation). We were  simply astounded at how NHT's SuperZero played us not so much the sound as themusic, the true test of any speaker's mettle.The SuperZero's speaker terminals are rugged five-way binding posts, and the  backside comes with two threaded holes for wall mounting. Wall placement,  whether the SuperZero isonthe wall or merely near it, will beef up the  bass a bit, but we found that it sounded the most natural with 2 or 3 feet of  space on all sides (stands are not included).--Michael MikesellPros:Gorgeous soundOutstanding timbral balanceIncredible quality for the priceCons:Lack of bass",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41R6S2T1G6L._SY300_.jpg,99.95,,Electronics,Home Audio,Stereo Components,Speakers,Bookshelf Speakers,

Pioneer PD-F908 101 CD-Changer (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"Pioneer's extended line of CD changers includes the PD-F908 with a  roulette rack that can accommodate up to 101 discs. This unit employs Pioneer's  compact center-loading system for extraordinarily efficient use of space, plus a  single-loader mechanism that quickly accesses any disc.The PD-F908 includes versatile edit features such as previous-disc scan. This  feature gives you quick access to the CDs you have listened to most recently. It  samples 10 seconds of discs you have listened to, starting with the most recent,  and continues on in reverse chronological order.CD-deck synchro simplifies CD-to-tape recording. Simply connect a Pioneer CD  player and a Pioneer tape deck that both feature CD-deck synchro. The CD player  and the cassette deck will automatically operate in sync: the deck automatically  stops when the CD player searches for the next programmed track to play, and  restarts when it's found. CD-deck synchro makes taping your favorite CDs easier  than ever.The best-selection memory function makes it easy for you to label and listen to  your favorite tracks in your CD collection. Simply press the ""best selection""  key when listening to the tracks you like to store them for later recall.When searching discs or tracks, you may sometimes find the first few seconds of  a song aren't enough to clearly identify it. That's why the Pioneer PD-F908  features a highlight scan. This function plays back sections 60 to 70 seconds  into each track it scans. It also lets you scan in several ways: you can check  each track on each disc, or the first track on each disc, or just the tracks and  discs selected for best-selection memory, or tracks and discs defined by  categories under the custom mode function.The Pioneer PD-F908 also features an optical digital output for transmission of  a pure digital bit stream to compatible receivers, and comes with a full-function remote control.Pioneer offers a warranty of a year on parts and labor for the PD-F908.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4106QEESD4L._SX300_.jpg,145.95,,Electronics,Car & Vehicle Electronics,Car Electronics,Car Audio,Changers,

Sony DCRPC105 MiniDV 1.0 Mega Pixel Handycam Camcorder with 2.5&quot; Swivel LCD,"Amazon.com Product Description The Sony DCR-PC105 goes beyond a regular video camcorder by being equipped with useful technological additions, such as a 1-megapixel digital camera and MPEG movie mode. The camcorder also features a 10x optical zoom, 2.5-inch LCD with touch panel control, color viewfinder, and USB streaming capabilities.Step-up ValueHere's a Sony feature that adds value to this digital camcorder and differentiates it from other models in the Sony lineup.Carl Zeiss Vario-Sonnar Lens:Famous for its superior sharpness and color accuracy, the Vario-Sonnar lens is the most advanced multi-layer optical coating system. The Carl Zeiss optical zoom brings the action close up from far away. In addition, precision digital zoom interpolation technology means that extreme digital zooming is clearer, with less distortion than previous types of digital zoom.Image StabilizationSony's SteadyShot picture stabilization keeps your images smooth and steady without degrading picture quality. The technology uses motion sensors, which tends to be more accurate than most other systems used in the camcorder market.OpticsThe multi-coated Carl Zeiss Vario-Sonnar lens ensures light capture will be well-contrasted and clear. The 1/4.7-inch advanced HAD CCD sensor accurately records images in vibrant color and sharp resolution. The PC105 has a robust 10x optical zoom that fits most purposes, but for extra distance the camera can reach 120x through the digital zoom. You can choose from three focusing systems to keep your images sharp and in focus: full range auto, manual, and spot focusing.More FeaturesYou can record video in low to no light situations with Sony's NightShot system, which uses infrared light to capture images invisible to the human eye. With the function on, subjects up to 10 feet away can be seen in total darkness. You can also use the color slow shutter for color night shots instead of the regular green night shot hue.Sony's Stamina power management system and InfoLithium battery give the PC105 a long operating time. To keep you informed of current battery life, Sony's AccuPower meter displays the number of minutes remaining right in the viewfinder.You can take digital stills and record small MPEG EX movies using the included 8 MB Memory Stick. This is where the 1 megapixel resolution CCD really shines, creating images with vibrant color and detail. The intelligent pop-up flash keeps your images well-lit and visible.The PC105 features an easy to see 2.5-inch color LCD and a color viewfinder. The screen's image can still be easily seen even in broad daylight with the use of the LCD backlight. The menu is accessed via a touch screen display on the LCD, reducing the clutter of buttons on the camera.The USB port can be used to bring in your stills onto the computer or stream video to make the camcorder function as a video conferencing tool or webcam. The IEEE1394 (Firewire) connection can be used for digital video editing on a computer, and S-Video and AV connections are also present for direct viewing on a television or VHS dubbing.MiniDV FormatMiniDV is the new preferred format for personal and broadcast-quality video, highly regarded for its high audio and image quality. With up to 540 lines of horizontal resolution and minimum color noise, MiniDV delivers a 20 percent clearer picture than analog camcorder formats. This is all delivered on a cassette that's 1/12th the size of a standard VHS tape. A MiniDV tape offers digital recording time of 2 full hours--20 times the capacity of a CD.ContentsThis package includes the PC105 camcorder, power adaptor/in-camera charger, InfoLithium rechargeable battery, 8 MB Memory Stick, wireless remote with 2 AA batteries, AV cable, lens cap, shoulder strap, USB cable, USB drivers, and LCD cleaning cloth.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SSY0GSKGL._SY300_.jpg,13.49,,Electronics,Camera & Photo,Video,Camcorders,,

Transients are faster, revealing greater detail, whether it's a light cymbal tap on your favorite CD or the tinkling of glass in a movie. Imaging is precise, with tremendous depth and the incredible accuracy of soundstage. And I400 MkII's improved phase response delivers a smoothness and feel that's so natural you'll marvel at just how good your system sounds.Monster's Patented Turbine RCA Connector: The World's FinestInterlink 400 MkII's award-winning RCA connectors have a specially designed collet strain relief that withstands pulls of 100 pounds or more, so the connector stays put, even when components are moved.

Sony HTC-800DP Home Theater System (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"Consisting of a space-saving combination DVD player and audio/video receiver powering a complete 5.1-channel speaker package, the 80-watts-per-channel HTC-800DP home theater spins DVD-Video movies as well as recordable CDs with your favorite MP3 music, filling your room with glorious surround sound. The system processes everything from DTS and Dolby Digital 5.1 discrete surround signals to Dolby Pro Logic II, which generates multichannel surround from any stereo source--movie or music. The system's onboard 32-bit surround processor also features Sony's own Digital Cinema Sound System (Cinema Studio EX), broadening your surround listening possibilities.Easy to assemble, the system includes all requisite cabling, and color-coded speaker connections simplify setup so you can enjoy your movies and music as quickly and accurately as possible.Whether your living room is currently home to an HDTV or you're merely thinking of ""someday,"" the HTC-800DP stands ready to deliver the full potential of your DVDs. Progressive scanning, referred to as 480p for the number of horizontal lines that compose the video image, creates a picture using twice the scan lines of a conventional DVD picture, giving you higher resolution and sharper images while eliminating nearly all motion artifacts.A composite-video input offers accompanying analog-audio inputs, accommodating most audio/video components and granting convenient AV switching: just channel the AV signals from your VCR or cable box (for instance) to the receiver, then route a single composite-video cable from the receiver's monitor output to your television.You'll need to supply your own composite- and/or component-video cables, and keep in mind that you'll need both connections in order to appreciate both the progressive-scan feature and the AV switching--the component-video output works only with the DVD image. If you have an older TV you may require a video modulator to convert the receiver's composite-video (yellow RCA jack) signal to an RF signal (which uses a thicker, threaded jack).The included speakers cover left, right, center, and left/right surround, along with a powerful, 100-watt subwoofer with a bass port for added low-frequency slam. A host of radio presets (20 FM, 10 AM) put all your favorite stations (and then some) right at your fingertips, and the receiver's amplifier uses discrete output transistors for clean, quality power.Optional mounting brackets or speaker stands (models WS-WV10D and WS-FV10D, respectively) simplify speaker placement, the assumption being that you'll want to place the center-channel speaker atop your television for optimal dialogue matching. All speakers are magnetically shielded to prevent distortion when placed on or near your TV.What's in the BoxCombination audio/video receiver and DVD player, SS-VE80P speaker package, SA-WMSP80 subwoofer, user's manual, all requisite speaker cable, and Remote Commander remote control.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/416SPKEGBEL._SY300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Television & Video,Home Theater Systems,,,

We laid out each component of the kit and dived right into networking our Windows 98 and Windows NT 4.0 PCs. Setup was surprisingly simple using the explicit instructions and illustrations. Most helpful was the supplied diagram of the finished network in the user's guide.We connected the hub to the power supply to ensure it was working, removed the covers of our computers, installed the network interface cards (NICs) in free PCI slots in each machine, and connected them to the hub with the provided cables. The cables themselves are 25 feet long, giving you more than enough distance between each computer in most cases. The NIC comes 100-Mbps ready, so you can upgrade to a 100-Mbps hub at a later time if necessary.After ensuring that all connections were secure, we started our machines and installed the network drivers. Installation went flawlessly. We networked our two computers to one common multifunction device, set up shared files, and a shared network connection.The Netgear SB-104 Network Ethernet Starter Kit is a great choice if you're looking for a simple way to network two PCs but want a convenient growth path in case your needs expand.

Pioneer CT-W205R Dual-Well Auto-Reverse Cassette Deck (Dolby B/C) (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"The CT-W205R offers everything you need in a 21st-century cassette deck: convenience, quality, and affordability. Convenience, because many cars have tape decks and most of us still have boatloads of perfectly good tapes lying around the house. Quality, because cassettescansound good, and CDs have heightened our sonic expectations. And affordability, because, after all, we're talking about cassettes here, and who wants to throw a lot of money in that direction?In this dual-well deck, one transport records and plays, while the other just plays--but both offer full autoreverse, even while recording. And with relay play (deck I to deck II), you'll get more than three hours of music by using two 100-minute tapes. A special rewind autoplay feature for deck I commences playback from the moment a cassette finishes rewinding, freeing you from monitoring the deck while the winding is in progress.For noise reduction, the CT-W205R is outfitted with Dolby B and C (Dolby B reduces noise by about 10 dB, while Dolby C knocks it down 20 dB), and it will play (but not record) tapes encoded with S-type noise reduction. A built-in MPX filter blocks the 19 kHz stereo-broadcast multiplex tone when you're recording off the air. This gives you more accurate Dolby noise-reduction tracking and clean recordings from FM radio.Full-logic controls offer electronic, rather than mechanical, control of the deck's transport system, giving you more reliability, smoother operation, and quicker one-touch controls. Other features include auto tape selector (normal/CrO2/metal), high-speed dubbing, auto space record mute, 15-track music search, six-LED level meters (with peak hold for setting optimal recording levels), and a .25-inch stereo headphone jack for private listening.What's in the BoxCassette deck, user's manual, and pair of stereo analog (left/right) RCA interconnects (one each for playback and record).",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41KEZGYBABL._SX300_.jpg,169.99,,Electronics,Home Audio,Stereo Components,Tape Decks,,

Panasonic SC-HT700 CD/DVD Home Theatre Sys (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"Early Adopters Pick: April 2003. This home theater system includes the world's slimmest 5-Disc DVD changer, as well as a six-speaker system.The SC-HT700 handles the audio end of a home theater, giving you surround sound decoding, amplification, and playback through a specially matched six-speaker system (left, center, right, left and right surround, and low-frequency subwoofer). The five-disc carousel system's DVD-Audio playback makes it adept at music as well as movies, offering super high-fidelity (192 kHz/24-bit) sound. DVD-Audio discs provide multichannel and stereo sound, incredible storage capacity, and unique bonus materials not available on regular audio CDs.DVD movies will look and sound great through the system's 54 MHz/10-bit video decoder, video depth enhancer, progressive-scan video output (for use with high-definition and HD-ready televisions), and Dolby Digital and DTS discrete 5.1-channel surround decoding and rendering. Progressive scanning, referred to as 480p for the number of horizontal lines that compose the video image, creates a picture using twice the scan lines of a conventional DVD picture, providing higher resolution and sharper images while eliminating nearly all motion artifacts.The speaker set includes four satellite speakers (front and rear left and right) powered by 45 watts each, a 90-watt center-channel speaker (critical for handling most of a movie's dialogue), and a powerful, 170-watt subwoofer specially designed for unobtrusive placement. All speakers are magnetically shielded to protect your TV from distortion induced by the speakers' magnetic fields. In addition, a digital-synthesized FM/AM tuner lets you listen to your favorite radio stations.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41S1YVPKQHL._SY300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Television & Video,Home Theater Systems,,,

Logitech QuickCam Pro PC Video Camera for Parallel Port,"Why settle for text when you can express yourself in living color? Send video e-mail, participate in video conferences, take pictures, and make videos with the inexpensive, easy-to-install QuickCam Pro PC video camera.The first thing we noticed when we took the QuickCam out of the box is that it is small and sturdy. Setting up the QuickCam was very easy--we just dropped in the software CD-ROM, followed the setup wizard, and then connected the QuickCam to our PC's parallel and keyboard ports. (Make sure you follow the directions in order.) We restarted the computer, clicked the QuickCam icon, and there we were, on screen, in beautiful 24-bit color.In our test, we created still shots and digital home videos. The camera adjusted itself surprisingly accurately and quickly for a variety of conditions. It focused down to just a few inches and compensated for lighting changes, from dim indoor shadows to sunlight through a window.We used the QuickCam software to organize our still shots and videos and to prepare them for e-mail transfer. The software took an AVI video clip lasting 105 seconds (80.7 MB), converted it to RealMedia (RM) format, and inserted it into an e-mail message as an attachment occupying only 1.89 MB. The conversion process took about 90 seconds, and although it introduced some expected graininess and compression artifacts, we were still very impressed with the resulting quality.We ran Microsoft NetMeeting, which allows you to participate in video conferences, and it correctly identified the QuickCam as the installed camera. To set up the conferencing feature, you'll need to review Microsoft NetMeeting's documentation.With its straightforward setup, intuitive software, stylish design, and low price, the QuickCam is both functional and lots of fun.--Mike BrownPros:Easy to set upPC and Mac compatibleGreat value, low priceCons:None",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41EYTQCQA0L._SX300_.jpg,67.99,,Electronics,Computers & Accessories,Webcams,,,

"Apple eMac Desktop 17&quot; M8950LL/A (1.0-GHz PowerPC G4, 128 MB RAM, 60 GB Hard Drive, DVD/CD-RW Drive)","Affordable, easy to use and surprisingly diminutive, Apple's new eMac series of desktop computers meshes well with situations where space is at a premium and the user is not necessarily a computing expert. It is therefore a particularly good fit in the elementary or high school classroom. In fact, Apple has designed the system with this function in mind. The mid-level model of the eMac roster is the eMac Desktop 17"" M8950LL/A, a smartly priced yet capable unit that's ready for the unique conditions of a multi-user educational environment.Driven by a 1 GHz PowerPC G4 processor and an ATI Radeon 7500 graphics chipset with 32 MB of dedicated DDR SDRAM memory, the eMac Desktop 17"" M8950LL/A sports plenty of front-end speed and satisfactory 3D graphics capabilities. Its 128 MB allotment of RAM may be a bit light for some purposes but can be upgraded to one full GB. Surprisingly, Apple has managed to equip the system with a generous 17-inch flat CRT display screen while adhering to the space-efficient exterior dimensions of its popular 15-inch-CRT-based iMac.The eMac Desktop 17"" M8950LL/A features a variety of data handling options, including an ample 60 GB hard drive for file and data storage, a DVD-ROM/CD-RW combo drive through which the user may burn audio and archival CDs and play DVD's (DVD writing is not supported), and a pair of high-speed FireWire 400 ports and five traditional USB 1.1 ports for interaction with peripheral devices such as scanners and digital cameras.E-communication support includes a standard 56K modem, a 10/100BASE-T Ethernet port and an 802.11 wireless connection (with the addition of Apple's AirPort Extreme card). Prospective buyers should note that the eMac permits the operation of Mac OS 9 in Classic mode and integrates with most existing printers and scanners. Bundled software includes Mac OS X, World Book 2003, Quicken 2003 Deluxe, and a broad range of powerful multimedia utilities.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31ZS5P7WM2L._SX300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Computers & Accessories,Desktops,,,

3dfx Voodoo3 3000 PCI 2D/3D Graphics Accelerator,"Looking for a no-frills PCI graphics card that can kick your anemic 3-D games into high gear? Consider the Voodoo3 3000 PCI from 3dfx. This 16 MB graphics card supports more 3D APIs than many competing products, offers glass-smooth performance for most games, and won't break the bank.We were a little disappointed when we opened the box, as the Voodoo3 3000 comes with no software bundle. A voucher is included for a software DVD decoder, but it would be much better if 3dfx just included the software with the device. It is immediately obvious upon looking at the card that few extra features are supported, as there are no TV input or output jacks. It's a graphics card, plain and simple.The first thing you'll notice after installing this card and booting up a game is its speed. We tested it with over 15 popular 3-D games, from flight simulators likeJane's USAFto first-person shooters likeUnreal Tournament. The results were universally impressive, with games running smooth as glass at all but the highest resolutions. The Voodoo3 3000 works particularly well with games that use 3Dfx's Glide API, likeUnreal Tournament. We were used to running that game with a RIVA TNT card at a resolution of 1,024 x 768, with both the detail settings at medium. We witnessed much smoother performance from the Voodoo3 3000 at this resolution with the detail settings at high.The caveat to all this speed is that it comes at the expense of maximum color depth. While the Voodoo3 3000 supports 32-bit color for normal 2-D acceleration (like working in Windows), it only goes as high as 16-bit for 3D-accelerated programs. This is not a big problem when it comes to games released in the last year or so, but more titles today are optimized for 32-bit color, and it's a shame this card can't handle it. It is obvious 3dfx focused on fast frame rates over all other considerations, but the fact that 3dfx's newer video card designs incorporate 32-bit color for 3-D proves the company has seen the errors of its ways.Two other potential drawbacks had less of a performance impact than we expected. The first is that this card supports only 16 MB of video memory. Most other cards on the market ship with 32 MB, making this seem a little skimpy. In practice, you'll have nothing to worry about. Windows performance is excellent, as the card supports 24-bit color at a maximum resolution of 2,046 x 1,536 and a refresh rate of 75 Hz. These numbers represent pure overkill for any monitor smaller than 24 inches, so users with 17-inch or 19-inch displays should have no complaints about Windows performance. Since only 16-bit color is supported in 3-D mode, the 16 MB of RAM is adequate to push enormous numbers of pixels at resolutions and refresh rates that should satisfy any gamer with a 17-inch or smaller monitor. Those of you with 19-inch or larger monitors may want to look elsewhere for a gaming card that will extract maximum performance from your display.The other reason buyers may hesitate to buy this card is that it's a PCI device. With so many computers shipping with AGP support, it makes little sense to buy a video card that uses a slower interface technology. Frankly, we didn't notice any difference. We've tested dozens of AGP cards with 16 MB of RAM, and the PCI version of the Voodoo3 3000 was able to best many of them--at least in 16-bit color. The good news is that this product is available in an AGP version, so you don't have to compromise if it really troubles you. The only real benefit we can see in using the AGP version of this card is that it will free up a PCI slot, which you can use for other devices.Overall, if you have a 17-inch monitor and high 3-D color depths are not important, the Voodoo3 3000 PCI is a smooth operator that can really make your games come to life. If you are looking for the ultimate video card, or a card with extra features like TV output, take a pass--and prepare to shell out two to three times the amount of cash you'd spend on this product.Pros:Smooth performanceGlide compatibilityGreat Windows performance, considering memory limitationsCons:No 24- or 32-bit color in 3-DOnly 16 MB of video RAMNo software bundle",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51V58ZN9V0L._SX300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Computers & Accessories,Computer Components,Graphics Cards,,
JVC GRD200 MiniDV 1.33 Megapixel Camcorder w/10x Optical Zoom,"Amazon.com Product Description  If style, quality, and convenience is what your searching for, the JVC GRD200 MiniDV camcorder is your answer to these needs and more. The GRD200 features a 1.33-megapixel CCD for superior video (540 Lines of resolution) and still photos (1600 x 1200), a bright 2.5-inch LCD, 200x digital zoom, a powerful software package, and much more.OpticsThe GRD200 features a high-performance 1/4-inch 1.3-megapixel CCD to capture high-quality video and digital photos. It's also fitted with a 10x optical zoom lens as well as a 200x digital hyper zoom with spline interpolation.Digital zoom is a powerful tool, but it can lead to ""jaggies""--zigzag contours that reduce picture quality. JVC has adopted spline interpolation to mathematically smooth such contours, making them look more natural. And since frame signals, not field signals, are processed, vertical resolution is increased, also improving quality.Digital Stills and MPEG VideoIn addition to high-quality video, the GRD200 also captures digital still photos in four resolution modes: 1600 x 1200 (UXGA), 1280 x 960 (SXGA), 1024 x 768 (XGA) or 640 x 480 (VGA). The images are stored on the included 8 MB MultiMedia card (MMC) or optional Secure Digital (SD) memory cards.You can also record small video clips (160 x 120 pixels) for distribution to friends and family over e-mail or the Internet using the MPEG-4 format feature. Video clips can be recorded from the real-time camera image or recorded video footage and stored on a the memory card. With the included 8 MB MMC card, you can record up to 7 minutes of MPEG-4 video.The JVC GRD200 features a large 2.5-inch LCD view screen and a color viewfinder.More Features2.5-inch 110k-pixel amorphous silicon LCD view screen and color viewfinderThe Picture Stabilizer system corrects camera shake instantly, giving you smooth and stable pictures.A combination of built-in Digital Special Effects and Wipes/Fades will give your videos a polished and professional look.PCM Digital Stereo Sound: 16-bit offers one set of stereo tracks and achieves the same quality as CD, while the 12-bit mode creates two sets of stereo tracks.Analog Input: allows you to record into the camcorder all of your memories recorded in the analog format, by allowing you to archive them onto Mini DV tapePower Linked Operation: prepares the camera to record simply by opening the LCD or pulling out the viewfinderUSB connectivity allows you to create image or video discs compatible with a variety of players.Inputs and OutputsThe GRD200 comes with the standard IEEE 1394 port (also referred to as FireWire), which provides a lossless connection to a PC or other DV machines. Additionally, the GRD200 includes a standard A/V cable to view video footage on your TV and a USB cable for transferring digital stills to your PC.MiniDV FormatMiniDV is the preferred format for personal and broadcast-quality video, highly regarded for its high audio and image quality. With up to 540 lines of horizontal resolution and minimum color noise, MiniDV delivers a 20-percent clearer picture than analog camcorder formats. This is all delivered on a cassette that's 1/12th the size of a standard VHS tape. A MiniDV tape offers digital recording time of 2 full hours--20 times the capacity of a CD.Power, Size, and ContentsThe GRD200 comes with a rechargeable lithium-ion battery pack. The camera itself measures 2.5 by 3.75 by 4.8 inches and weighs 17 ounces. This package includes the GRD200 camcorder, battery pack, AC adapter, remote control, shoulder strap, USB and A/V cables, 8 MB MMC memory card, and a CD-ROM with software.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51M8VQ75B4L._SY300_.jpg,549.99,,Electronics,Camera & Photo,Video,Camcorders,,

Philips DVD726 Progressive-Scan DVD Player,"Philips's slim, affordable DVD726 features high-end progressive-scan component-video outputs and built-in decoding for MP3 music files, as well as JPEG image CD playback so you can enjoy digital slideshows right in the living room. It also is compatible with PAL- and NTSC-formatted discs (so long that your TV is PAL or NTSC compatible). The DVD726's Smart Picture feature offers five preset picture settings: multimedia, rich, natural, soft, and personal, which let you tailor the image you see to the type of program your watching.Whether your living room is currently home to an HDTV or you're merely thinking of ""someday,"" the DVD726 stands ready to deliver the full potential of DVDs. Progressive scanning, referred to as 480p for the number of horizontal lines that compose the video image, creates a picture using twice the scan lines of a conventional DVD picture, giving you higher resolution and sharper images while eliminating nearly all motion artifacts.The DVD726 also performs 3:2 pulldown. DVD mastering introduces a common distortion when adjusting 24 frames-per-second movies to 30 fps video; 3:2 pulldown digitally corrects this distortion, removing the redundant information to display a film-frame-accurate picture.The player will play JPEG images one by one automatically, letting you zoom in, rotate, or flip the picture vertically or horizontally. For MP3 playback, the player offers track time display, album and track selection, and repeat (disc/album/track). It supports nested directory levels up to eight levels, as well as a total of 32 albums and 500 different tracks.A set of left/right analog-audio outputs channel audio to Dolby Pro Logic receivers and stereo televisions. Both Dolby Digital and DTS 5.1-channel surround-sound signals can be routed through the player's coaxial digital-audio output for direct connection to a full-featuredaudio/video receiver.Playback options include five-disc resume and bookmarking, which lets you pick-up where you left off on your five most recently viewed DVDs (not applicable for MP3 or JPEG CDs), enhanced parental control (with 80-disc lockout), and picture zoom for magnification of select images.What's in the BoxDVD-Video player, zappa remote control with batteries, user's manual, stereo analog audio interconnect, composite-video cable.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21ATQ8DKMWL._SX300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Television & Video,DVD Players & Recorders,DVD Players,,

Humminbird SmartCast RF10 Mobile Station 4-Inch Waterproof Fishfinder,"You can't always be a purist. When it's ""fish or cut bait,"" you want the fish, and Humminbird's SmartCast RF10 mobile station is just the device to help you reel 'em on in. You get all the benefits of a traditional fishfinder, plus the freedom and mobility to fish wherever you want. Just hook the supplied remote sonar sensor to your line, cast it out, reel it in, and watch the handy 3.1 x 2.5-inch display to identify your target fish. The sensor gives you a view of the fish, the bottom, and the underwater structure right where your line is, in real time. The unit not only helps you find fish--it also contributes to your boating safety.The remote sonar sensor uses an internal sonar transducer to collect and wirelessly transmit data to the display. Whether you're casting from the bank, a dock, a kayak, a canoe, or a float tube, SmartCast is ready to perform. Its impressive, 100-foot radius extends down as well as around, giving you an ultra-wide coverage equal to twice your depth (down to 100 feet of water, of course). A one-touch menu navigation controls fish ID, depth range, fish alarm, and sensitivity. The 8 AA battery-powered display itself is lightweight, compact, and totally waterproof and even offers a backlight for night fishing.Wet Switch technology maximizes battery life by shutting down the display whenever the remote sonar sensor is out of water. The user-replaceable remote sonar sensor gives you around 400 hours of in-water use. An A/B channel option lets you use two remote sonar sensors in the same area at the same time for greater coverage (additional purchase required, sensor model number RF40). The base unit, which supports the display, comes outfitted with an anti-skid rubber bottom. It also converts to a handy carrying case--the unit folds in for protected transport and storage.What's in the BoxRemote sonar sensor, base unit with display, and a user's manual.Note: The RF10 is not intended for ice fishing or use in below-freezing temperatures.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41R2AMSQKAL._SY300_.jpg,119.0,,Electronics,Car & Vehicle Electronics,Marine Electronics,Boating GPS Chartplotters,,

"HP Pavilion ze4365us Laptop (1.80-GHz Athlon XP-M 2200+, 512 MB RAM, 40 GB Hard Drive, DVD/CD-RW Drive)","HP has designed its new Pavilion ze4365us Notebook PC to meet the needs of those who require punchy performance at an affordable price point. For most typical business, personal, and leisure tasks, the Pavilion ze4365us should suffice quite nicely.At 12.96 by 10.72 by 1.57 inches, the unit is a wee bit larger than some of the alternatives. It is conveniently lightweight though, at a mere 7.25 pounds. Inside, HP has installed a capable yet cost-effective 1.8 GHz Mobile AMD Athlon XP processor 2200+ with battery-conserving PowerNow Technology, 512 MB of DDR SDRAM memory, and an ATI Mobility Radeon graphics chipset with 64 MB of shared (not dedicated) memory. This is an ample powerplant for a mobile machine, though it shouldn't be expected to efficiently drive and display some high-end 3-D games or animation packages.The system features an adequate 40 GB hard disk for file and application storage and a convenient DVD+CD-RW combo drive for listening to and burning music CDs and playing the latest movies. DVD writing is not offered in this stock configuration. The system's crisp 15-inch XGA TFT display supports images of 1024x768 resolution, and its 16-bit Sound Blaster Pro-compatible audio chipset and integrated Altec Lansing-designed speakers deliver accurate, full-bodied sound.Controlling the Pavilion ze4365us is a snap. The unit features a full size 88-key keyboard with embedded numeric keypad, a Touch Pad with on/off button, and a dedicated vertical scroll up/down pad. Other amenities include two traditional USB 1.1 ports for plug and play peripherals, an IEEE 1394 FireWire port for fast interaction with external devices such as digital camcorders, and an S-Video TV-out.

Uniden HS910 Headset for Cordless Phones,"Take cordless convenience one step further with complete hands-free operation. Increase your productivity, work on other projects, and enjoy more freedom of movement, all without straining your neck trying to support a telephone handset.The HS910 is comfortable and lightweight; after a few minutes, you'll forget you're wearing it. The headset attaches to the cordless handset's 2.5mm headset jack. (We tested the unit on a Uniden EXS 9110, but it fits any 2.5mm-compatible cordless phone.) Once the headset is attached, you cannot use the handset for talking or listening, but you can us it to answer incoming calls and to dial. Having a belt clip on your cordless handset is especially helpful, giving your phone complete unobtrusive portability as you walk around.With the headset, your caller will hear your voice slightly softened compared with how you sound on the handset alone, but otherwise, the headset introduces no additional noise or distortion, and it doesn't reduce the handset's range or battery life. In our tests, even after an hour of continuous use, the headset had not become uncomfortable. For very long calls, you can rotate the headset, as the unit is designed for both left-ear and right-ear listening.The Uniden HS910 headset is a product that really works as advertised.

Panasonic PV-V4520 4-Head Hi-Fi VCR,"The Panasonic PV-V4520 VCR is part of Panasonic's latest line of VCRs designed for the year 2000 and beyond.

Infinity RS-4 Floor-Standing Speaker System (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"Well-balanced, reasonably priced floorstanding  loudspeakers are not easy to come by, but Infinity's Reference  Series RS-4 is a great example of dynamic, nearly full-range  loudspeakers that don't require a second mortgage to enjoy.On the Infinity RS-4 speakers, music ranging from rock to classical and new age  sounded equally at ease, with acoustic instruments and voices  sounding especially full-bodied and natural. We were immediately  impressed with the high sensitivity of the RS-4 speakers: At 90 dB, even small  integrated amps or receivers can drive this system toward its 112- dB limit. Even under dynamic duress, the Infinity RS4 system maintained its  ""snap"" and punchiness, never flattening out or congesting at the  loudest passages of our test material.At its loudest, the RS-4 system got a bit ""peaky"" in the high frequencies, and the highs in general sounded ""harder"" or more metallic than those from better, higher-priced speakers, but these qualities pale beside the RS-4's considerable strengths.The RS-4 imaged well and its bass extension was strong, commanding  decent--and clean--low frequencies even in smaller rooms. Used  with a powered subwoofer, the RS-4 kicked even lower, but the subwoofer  was by no means necessary. If you're looking for a well-rounded  speaker pair to upgrade your music system or start building a  home theater, the magnetically shielded Infinity RS-4 speaker system is a fine place to  start.Pros:High sensitivityGood tonal balanceStrong dynamicsEasy placementCons:High frequencies slightly ""hard""",http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-site/icons/no-img-sm._CB192198896_.gif,,,Electronics,Home Audio,Stereo Components,Speakers,Floorstanding Speakers,

Panasonic SC-AK47 CD Compact Stereo System (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"Panasonic's SC-AK47 music system raises the stakes for quality two-channel playback. This system is not trying to ride the growing surround-sound trend; rather, it delivers open, effortless playback from CD, cassette, and radio through two well-engineered and well-amplified loudspeakers. (The system does sport outputs for two additional speakers, but it doesn't process Dolby Pro Logic surround sound.)Panasonic not only grasps good engineering principles, but also understands that compact music systems will find themselves with many different owners in many different environments, necessitating the option of a broad array of equalization (EQ). With one user-definable and six preset EQ settings, two levels of 3-D acoustic-image EQ, and two levels of bass-pumping super woofer settings--to say nothing of the pure and direct flat (no-effects) setting--the SC-AK47 has the flexibility to adjust to anyone's taste or circumstances. But it's the fundamentals that appeal to us: tastefully balanced four-way speakers (three-way speakers superimposed over 7-inch super woofers,) backed by amazingly clear and stable 85 watts-plus per channel power.The SC-AK47 isn't perfect, of course: the bass doesn't extend much below 60 Hz, the five-CD player takes ages to switch discs, you can't change other CDs while one disc is playing, and a palm-sized remote-control does not allow adequate space for all the buttons required of a full-function remote. All the same, the fundamentals--along with the many tasteful extras-- more than compensate for these shortcomings.You get terrific sound from the dual-well cassette decks (often the first thing to go in lower-end models), good off-axis frequency response (you don't have to be right in front of the speakers for them to sound good), and the system plays very loudly before succumbing to distortion or bass compression. Other niceties include small rubber feet for each of the three pieces, removable speaker grilles, and a digital volume control that extends down to -82 dB (many cut to silence at -60 dB and above, limiting your choices in low-volume listening). In all, a wonderful little system that we highly recommend.Pros:Great CD soundFlexible equalizationWell-thought-out designAbove-average cassette soundCons:Slow disc skip/exchangeCan't change discs while one is playing",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41RTSYSCPDL._SX300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Home Audio,Compact Stereos,,,

It even includes MusicMatch MP3 recording software to get you started burning your own MP3 CDs with up to 10 hours of music. Up to 200 seconds of esp-Xtreme skip protection with MP3/WMA files (45 seconds for audio CDs) makes this CD player virtually skip-free in most conditions and a great choice for joggers and runners.The CD player's SmartTrax navigation technology helps you quickly access specific songs or playlists among the hundreds of tracks on an MP3/WMA-encoded CD-R/CD-RW. Using a library of computer-generated identification tags to identify digital audio files by title, artist, album, year, genre, and track number, the SmartTrax file-management system can ""read"" song data from your recordable CDs, letting you view song data and create playlists at the touch of a button. SmartTrax can read the song data even before the song is played. A three-line dot-matrix display shows SmartTrax data and allows 30-track/folder programmability.Other playback features include Digital Bass Boost Surround for extra low-end slam and added musical depth, three preset equalization settings, and a hold switch to prevent unintended interruptions in playback (and to save batteries by negating playback when the player is stopped). The unit operates for approximately 18 hours on two AA batteries, either alkalines or rechargeables (no batteries included), and a handy car kit with DC power adapter lets you travel in style with no batteries required.What's in the BoxCD player, car cassette adapter, 4.5V car DC power adapter, headphones (e.clipz clip-on headphones), carry strap, and MusicMatch software.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41365WAQ0EL._SX300_.jpg,81.1,,Electronics,Portable Audio & Video,MP3 Players & Accessories,MP3 Player Accessories,Speaker Systems,

Panasonic PV-9450 4-Head Hi-Fi VCR,"The Panasonic PV-9450 is not cluttered with features that you'll probably never use anyway, but it does offer those that are important: 4-head video quality, stereo hi-fi sound, and on-screen programming. The unit also includes Panasonic's Multi-Brand Universal Light Tower Remote, which works with most TVs and cable boxes.The PV-9450 impressed us with its simplicity; we took it out of the box, connected an antenna and TV, and plugged it in. We then followed the initial on-screen setup instructions and, by itself, the unit found the active broadcast channels and even set its clock. We played a prerecorded tape and found the picture to be crisp and sharp. The PV-9450's audio was rich and full, characteristic of hi-fi stereo.Another interesting feature of the PV-9450 is a time stamp, which, at the beginning of a videotape, displays the time and date of your recording and the channel from which it was recorded. A tape-position display shows how close you are to the beginning or end of a tape.The remote control, unlike the VCR, is a bit bulky, and its many buttons get in the way of the few you'll use most of the time. Of course, it is a universal remote, and, as such, must sacrifice some design elegance.If the most important features to you are 4-head picture quality and hi-fi stereo sound, then Panasonic PV-9450 is a sensible choice.Pros:Universal remote works with most TVs and cable boxes4 heads for a clear pictureHi-fi stereo for great soundCons:Limited feature set",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31V6AF5RHHL._SX300_.jpg,88.0,,Electronics,Television & Video,VCRs,,,

Microsoft Cordless Wheel Mouse (PS2),"Designed to fit any hand comfortably, the Microsoft C57-00001 Cordless Wheel Mouse helps reduce clutter on your desk because it has no cords to get tangled.

Contax TVS 5MP Digital Camera w/ 3x Optical Zoom,"The Contax TVS digital camera makes use of a Carl Zeiss Vario Sonnar lens and a 5.2 megapixel sensor to create high-quality images that can be printed at sizes of up to 20 by 30 inches. Encased in a smooth titanium body and sporting a sapphire shutter release button, the TVS is stylistically impressive and durable enough to last through all kinds of photography projects. The camera also has a 3x optical zoom, movie mode, USB and video connections, and compatibility with MMD and SD memory cards.Optics and ResolutionThe Carl Zeiss lens' anti-reflection coating keeps unwanted light from flooding the CCD sensor, meaning images will have higher contrast, crisper colors, and more shadow detail. The large 1/1.8-inch CCD yields an effective 5 million pixels, and captures images with resolutions as high as 2560 by 1920 pixels. This means you can create quality, poster-sized prints of up to 20 by 30 inches. For greater customization and to save memory, you can select lower resolution settings (1600 x 1200, 1280 x 960, 640 x 480). The TVS has a 3x optical zoom and a 4x digital zoom, for a total zoom range of 12x.Storage and TransferThe Contax camera is compatible with both MultiMedia (MMC) and Secure Digital (SD) cards. This allows greater flexibility in sharing or transporting your photos among a variety of electronic devices, such as PDAs and cell phones. Use the built-in USB port to connect to a computer for fast and easy transfer of images.Movie ModeThe TVS can also record up to full-motion video clips with or without sound. Clips are saved in standard AVI format and can be set to two different resolution settings, 320 x 120 (up to 30 seconds per clip) and 160 x 120 (up to 120 seconds per clip). You can also view your video and photos on a TV using the video out port.More FeaturesThe 1.6-inch LCD monitor helps you compose your shots and navigate through the camera's settings with an onscreen menu. The dual backlight system increases light transmission from the LCD to increase visibility even in full daylight. The camera has fully automatic functions such as focus, exposure, and white balance for easy operation, but you can set them to presets or manual mode for greater control.Power, Size, and ContentsThe camera is powered by a rechargeable lithium ion battery. It measures 4.4 x 2.36 x 1.3 inches and weighs 7.4 ounces without batteries. This package includes the TVS digital camera, strap, USB cable, battery, and remote control.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41925QPQ8VL._SX300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Camera & Photo,Digital Cameras,Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,,

KLH 9000B Home Theater Speaker System (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"Don't let the high costs of extravagant home-theater systems keep you from experiencing the thrill of a dynamic film right in your living room. With the KLH 9000B Home-Theater Speaker System, any Dolby Pro Logic- or Dolby Digital/DTS-equipped surround amp can fill a room with sound from six  separate loudspeakers.The compact system is made up of four identical two-way speakers that serve as left and right front speakers and surround satellites; a three-way, horizontally configured center-channel speaker (shielded so you can lay it atop your TV); and a ported, passive subwoofer.The 9000B is a perfect introduction to the world of home theater. It doesn't pretend to be a high-end system, but the speakers blend well for a clear, balanced sound that we found particularly impressive with multichannel  music software. Setup was easy and intuitive using the provided diagram and speaker wire. You won't need a subwoofer output on your amplifier or receiver, as the subwoofer gets wired in line with the front-channel speakers.The subwoofer, in fact, brought impressive heft to the sound, given its small size and passive design. Movie playback sounded reasonably full-bodied despite the fact that five of the six speakers are quite small. The low end didn't have the definition of larger and pricier bookshelf speakers but for rounding out the sonic picture it did just fine.The system as a whole fared well and, in fact, sounded its best during louder passages. The subwoofer comes fitted with a self-resetting circuit breaker to prevent it from damage when you play music at loud volumes.Pros:Simple setupCohesive soundPlays well at loud volumeCons:Slightly muted high frequenciesMuddy bass",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71A9XHW8X7L._SX300_.gif,149.95,,Electronics,Home Audio,Stereo Components,Speakers,Speaker Systems,

Zenith DVD-2200 DVD Player,"Price-wise, you can't beat Zenith's DVD2200 DVD-Video player. By today's standard, it's a basic model, with a single digital-audio output and no built-in Dolby Digital decoder. However, the DVD2200's price is amazing when compared to the first generation of DVD players.This model is compatible with both Dolby Digital and Digital Theater Sound (DTS) formats. Using the coaxial digital-audio output, you can connect the DVD2200 to a preamp or AV receiver with DTS and/or Dolby Digital processing and enjoy surround-sound movies in either format. That's a big plus, especially as more DVD titles are released in DTS. The DVD2200 has a 10-bit digital-to-analog video decoder, as opposed to the 8-bit models that were common when the DVD format was first introduced. It also incorporates a 24-bit, 96 kHz audio D/A converter, which translates into higher-quality sound--particularly when using the DVD2200 as a CD player. Zenith supplies a full-function remote control that lets you enlarge images to either four or 16 times their normal size--a great feature for zooming in on credits at the end of a movie. Additional features include a single S-Video output, an intuitive onscreen menu, parental control, and 3D Virtual Surround.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61TDXW9BACL._SX300_.gif,,,Electronics,Television & Video,DVD Players & Recorders,DVD Players,,
"Polaroid JoyCam 500 Instant Camera Kit, Silver","The Polaroid JoyCam Kit includes Polaroid's latest JoyCam camera model and a 10-frame film cartridge. The Polaroid JoyCam is a revision of the instant camera design that made Polaroid famous. It has a small body in comparison to its bulky predecessors and offers a frame counter and a built-in selectable flash with a flash-ready light. Easy enough for a child to use, the Polaroid JoyCam operates with the push of a single button--no focusing is necessary.The design feature that sets the Polaroid JoyCam apart from other instant cameras is its film delivery system--or lack of one. Traditional instant cameras relied on film cartridges with built-in batteries to enable the camera to expel each shot; however, this model works without a battery. Instead, users pull a plastic ring on the side of the camera to extract the exposed frame. This manual process enables Polaroid to offer a lighter camera body and compatible instant film cartridges at a more reasonable price.The Polaroid JoyCam takes pictures at a range of 3 feet to infinity. It works with Polaroid 500 instant film and produces pictures that measure 4.4 by 2.5 inches, which is slightly smaller than traditional Polaroid shots. The kit includes one box of Polaroid 500 film, providing you with everything you need to start snapping pictures immediately.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41YPZQJ304L._SX300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Camera & Photo,Film Photography,Film Cameras,Instant Cameras,

Harman Kardon AVR 7000 Dolby Digital/DTS Audio/Video Receiver (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"Heading up Harman Kardon's superb line of surround receivers is the flagship AVR 7000, which cranks out 100 quality watts to all five channels across the audible frequency spectrum. Harman Kardon, long a champion of the importance of high current over high power, offers both in this model: the AVR 7000 delivers a staggering 75 amps of High Current Capability (HCC) to drive the most demanding speaker loads without distortion.And while sound quality is definitely a priority here--we're talking about Harman Kardon, after all--a lot of circuit-design and digital signal processing know-how went into this receiver.Most significantly, the receiver offers Harman's exclusive Logic 7 and VMAx surround modes (intelligent 5.1- and two-channel surround matrices for any sound source--stereo or otherwise) and onboard decoding of Dolby Digital and DTS surround formats in addition to HDCD. Throw in 30 FM/AM station presets alongside S-video and component-video switching, and you're looking at your key to top-flight music and home-theater enjoyment for well under $2,000.The AVR 7000 can also supply sound for two rooms (with the use of an external infrared remote sensor), and the receiver comes with one set of stereo RCA outputs, composite- and S-video outputs, and a separate, limited-function remote control for this purpose.With all of its features, however, nothing gets in the way of sound performance. The tone controls--the AVR 7000 offers actual bass and treble knobs--can be taken out of the audio circuit to keep the audio signal path as short and clean as possible. In listening to CDs through either the analog or digital inputs, we found that the AVR 7000 opens a big, natural window on the music. (We recommend using your CD player's analog outputs only if it has no digital outputs or if it's a player with extremely high-quality analog circuitry.)With the AVR 7000, the qualities we expect from separates (preamplifier and amplifier components) but don't usually get from integrated receivers abound: a wonderful sense of air and ambiance; complex layers of rich harmonics; a beautiful nuance in vocal delivery; wide dynamics and subtle microdynamics; smooth, extended high frequencies; and a bottom end that is at once powerful and well defined but never muddy.Surround decoding of Dolby Digital- and DTS-encoded discs, performed by 24-bit, 96 kHz Crystal DSP (digital signal processing) circuits, is just as impressively clear and dynamic.The AVR 7000's biggest drawback is that you can't adjust the speaker delays for surround formats other than Dolby Digital. Because most living rooms do not lend themselves to optimal home-theater speaker placement, it's standard for receivers to let you input and store the distance (in either feet or meters) from your various speakers to your primary listening position. This ensures that the sounds from your speakers arrive at your ears simultaneously, as if you were equidistant from all speakers. You can, however, adjust the relative volume levels of each channel, which is actually more important than adjusting the delay times.In practice, the AVR 7000's surround sound coherence is excellent, even with DTS-encoded multichannel music CDs (though the presentation in one of our less ideal rooms was not as seamless as it might have been).The AVR 7000 also lets you toggle between a given component's analog and digital outputs from the remote control--a function that few receivers offer. Granted, this feature will appeal mainly to audiophiles who are interested in comparing, for instance, the sound of a component's analog outputs to its digital output, or the effect that different analog audio interconnects have on the sound (using the digital output as a reference). But Harman excels in this kind of detail-oriented feature, and it's good to know it's available here.Unlike most of the overhyped proprietary DSP modes out there, Harman Kardon's own Logic 7 (multichannel) and VMAx (two-channel) surround modes work extremely well, in most cases audibly improving over regularly decoded, discrete source material (like Dolby Digital and DTS)--no small feat. Logic 7 also instantaneously generates 5.1-channel information from two-channel material such as CDs, television, VHS tapes, and other sources, letting you take full advantage of your surround system without the annoying artifacts that often accompany such faux-surround algorithms.Setting up the AVR 7000 is, not surprisingly, a complex and time-consuming effort, but one that pays off. To its credit, the unit boasts a terrific onscreen setup display (though it does reset your settings when you revisit a given parameter), one of the best owner's manuals we've seen, and an uncluttered, illuminated, full-function remote control capable of operating up to eight devices (choose from 17 brands of DVD players and over 80 brands of televisions).The only other drawback worth mentioning is that the system often takes a few seconds to lock onto a new sound format, whether it's DTS or an HDCD-encoded CD. This means that you'll occasionally miss the first couple seconds of sound, but you can always preselect the format or simply start the track anew. This was not an issue in DVD video titles, where the surround format is usually triggered long before you actually need to hear sound.When it's all configured and set to go, you'll have most of the home theater world at your remote-clicking fingertips, from full future-ready capabilities in the receiver's 5.1-channel analog inputs (perfect for DVD audio) to component-video switching for videophile DVD video performance.If you're hankering for top-of-the-line audio performance and highest-level video switching, the AVR 7000 is a real bargain.--Michael MikesellPros:Sound quality rivals separatesExcellent build qualityLoaded with featuresConverts S-video to composite-videoRemote control lets you toggle between analog and digital inputs for a given componentControls easy to navigateDefeatable tone controlsFuture ready with 5.1-channel analog inputsCons:Lengthy setup procedureNo speaker-delay settings for DTS surround soundNo phono inputSystem can take a few seconds to catch up with a new sound source",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41BRYS92ZVL._SX300_.jpg,9.99,,Electronics,Home Audio,Stereo Components,Receivers & Amplifiers,Component Receivers,

KLH AV5001 Floor-Standing Speaker (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"Talk about a lot of bang for the buck--KLH's AV5001 floorstanding speaker provides just that with a 12-inch woofer and a 12-inch passive radiator for deep, powerful bass. For the remainder of the frequency range, KLH uses a 5.25-inch liquid-cooled midrange cone and a 1-inch liquid-cooled dome tweeter. And because the AV5001 has high sensitivity, you can drive it to ear-crunching indoor levels with just about any amplifier.The AV5001, which comes in a black-ash vinyl veneer, is relatively large and designed to sit directly on the floor. (You may want to consider wedging rubber feet or cones under the AV5001 in order to keep all of that bass energy from resonating through your floorboards instead of radiating into your room.) As far as hooking up the AV5001, we weren't crazy about the spring-loaded wire-clip terminals. Five-way binding posts would be more rugged and convenient. Otherwise, the AV5001 appears to be a solidly made speaker.Sonically, it may not be the last word in subtlety and nuance, especially for jazz and classical fans. But then, refinement is the last thing needed for some music. If you love to hear a Marshall stack churning waves of thrashing guitar notes, or a kick drum delivered with the room-rattling power of a crashing safe, or pants-flapping drum and bass, then the AV5001 will have you on your feet and dancing. In addition, vocals sound clear and strong, and the top end has plenty of shimmer and zing. Overall, the AV5001 is a clean and powerful speaker.No one speaker can satisfy everybody, and KLH's AV5001 probably won't get your juices flowing if you're into classical or acoustic music. But if you like hard-hitting music that's rich in bass and treble, the AV5001 will make it come alive.--Wayne GarciaPros:Powerful, dynamic bassEasy to drivePlays loud without strainCons:Bass can be overpoweringClip-type speaker terminals require bare-wire cable",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31MW46G222L._SY300_.jpg,,,Electronics,Home Audio,Stereo Components,Speakers,Floorstanding Speakers,

Advent AW870 Wireless Powered Speakers (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"Are there places in your home where you'd love to enjoy music, but don't want to lay speaker wire or drill holes to get it there? Advent's wireless powered speaker system lets you import music from CD, radio, DVD, or any audio source to nearly any room in the house.Advent's AW870 speaker system uses the FM (frequency-modulation) technique employed in radio to broadcast audio to the two loudspeakers, each of which houses its own 15-watt amplifier. The speakers, which are identical, offer a roll-on power/volume switch and a separate switch for designating either speaker as left, right, or mono--highly desirable when playing with different positions. (If you're listening to monaural material--including anything recorded prior to about 1954--the Mono switch will allow you to cut down on transmission static without compromising music delivery.)The AW870 system comes with two main parts: the transmitter and the speakers, all of which require close proximity to an AC outlet unless you opt to battery-power the speakers. The transmitter, about five inches in diameter, plugs into a wall outlet and hooks into your desired audio source via a single stereo RCA cable.We positioned the transmitter's tuner arbitrarily while setting up and were pleased to find that the speakers' tuner zeroed in on the appropriate frequency with little adjustment. In fact, the thing that gave us the most trouble was the fact that the speakers use individual volume controls. With no master ""balance"" knob, the two speakers have to be manually adjusted for equal volume.The transmitter range seemed surprisingly large, though static and crackle increased as we got farther away from the transmitter. Listening from across a room worked best, though the omnidirectional transmitter works through walls and floors as well. Powered with batteries (eight ""C"" cell, not provided), the AW870 speakers make ideal portable deck speakers when you don't feel like moving your whole stereo just to enjoy the nice weather.The sound from our test CDs closely resembled that of clear FM radio: dynamically compressed and slightly hissy even at its quietest. As speakers go, these are decent but not great. As with any sound system, a boost in convenience often requires a small sacrifice in quality, and this is true of the AW870 wireless system.Pros:Intuitive setupFlexible placementBattery-power optionCons:Separate volume control for each speakerNo tone controls (bass or treble)",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71FJ0EPC0KL._SX300_.gif,,,Electronics,Home Audio,Stereo Components,Speakers,Speaker Systems,

Uniden BC895XLT 300-Channel TrunkTracker Scanner (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"The Uniden Bearcat TrunkTracker BC 895XLT is a scanner for the serious radio enthusiast. The BC 895XLT is packed with an impressive array of features, such as trunk tracking, delay, lockout, search and scan, Continuous Tone Control Squelch System (CTCSS), one-touch weather scan, and severe weather alert. In addition, this scanner has a strong frequency range of 29 MHz to 965 MHz.Setting up the BC 895XLT was simple--we attached the antenna, plugged in the AC adapter, and turned on the unit. With so many function buttons on the face of the unit, using the BC 895XLT may seem daunting without consulting the manual. However, the manual is incredibly user friendly, with definitions of all functions, pictures, and step-by-step instructions for performing certain applications. It also includes a foldout diagram of the face of the unit with descriptions of each button so you can easily reference while skimming the manual.With 300 channels, the BC 895XLT provides more programmable channels than most scanners.  Organized into 10 bank keys that hold 30 programmed frequencies each, the scanner can also be preprogrammed with 10 priority channels. We had no problem performing basic operations and programming active frequencies into selected channels and banks. Features such as scanning, channel lockout, weather alert, and searching were relatively easy to figure out using the operating guide. More advanced features such as CTCSS operation and trunk tracking, while more complicated, were also accessible.One nice touch is the squelch control, which raises or lowers the ""Squelch Gate"" so that you can control what kind of signals get in and eliminate the constant hiss that accompanies weak signals. We also appreciated the adjustable LCD backlight, which makes the display easy to read in almost any condition, and the desktop stand, which allows you to see and use the scanner at a more viewable angle. The auxiliary jack lets you connect an external recorder so that you can automatically record any activity on a specified channel. There is also an external speaker jack that can be used to connect headphones for private listening.The unit ships with a Betty Bearcat Starter Frequency Guide that lists some statewide and city frequencies used by police and fire departments, weather services, forest rangers, as well as ham radio operators and miscellaneous frequency assignments. You can also order the Betty Bearcat Regional and National Police Directories or Mr. Scanner's Local Frequency List for more in-depth listings including rescue squad, local government, forestry radio, marine radio, aircraft, amateur radio, and federal government frequencies.If you're interested only in simple radio scanning and tracking, then take a look at a lower-end model. But if you're an expert radio operator looking for a super-powerful tracking device, you'll be thrilled with the BC 895XLT. The folks at Uniden thought of everything when designing this one.Pros:Easy-to-understand operation guideSimple programmingTrunk tracking and CTCSS for more advanced usersEasy-to-read display",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71VWQ1Y92XL._SX300_.gif,,,Electronics,Security & Surveillance,Radio Scanners,,,

It can also convert interlaced to progressive scanning for an exceptionally accurate 480P signal.

Adjustable gamma allows you to choose from three different gamma settings to bring out detail in dark scenes. Even though the DVD-H1000 outputs a 480P signal formatted for 16:9 widescreen viewing, it can correctly display a 4:3 image on a 16:9 screen using the original scaling algorithm of a DVD disc designed for 4:3 viewing.The Panasonic DVD-H1000 design incorporates audiophile-grade components like the newly developed electrolytic capacitors and high-capacity (0.1 microfarads) copper film capacitors. The R-core toroidal transformer minimizes power supply leakage flux for clean power supply operation that helps maintain treble clarity and bass performance. This player also offers an eight-block isolated chamber to avoid mechanical and electrical interference, further preserving audio and video signal purity. Its hybrid metal construction effectively disperses and suppresses resonance peaks, with large BMC insulator feet helping to absorb external vibrations to further reduce unwanted noise. Virtual Battery Operation helps prevent AC power supply noise from entering the audio circuitry.This unit includes digital outputs for DTS and Dolby Digital decoders.

Panasonic gives you the option of turning the anti-skip feature on or off, which is useful since the technology uses slightly more battery power. These battery-saving features are a plus, but the Panasonic SL-S361C can operate up to a lengthy 25 hours on 2 AA alkaline batteries.Besides the extras, Panasonic's SL-S361C includes all the essential CD features, including repeat track, CD pause, 24-track programmability, and random play.
